## 📌 Executive Summary
Transplant vein restenosis is the main complication affecting the long-term graft patency after coronary artery bypass grafting, mainly caused by VSMC proliferation and migration (initiating factors), leading to intimal hyperplasia and restenosis. We speculate that the MN drug delivery system can be used to target transplanted veins, suppress restenosis by inhibiting SMC proliferation, reduce the incidence of restenosis after coronary artery bypass grafting, and delay the occurrence of restenosis. The study was conducted in in vitro and in vivo experiments using a jugular vein transplantation model to evaluate the safety, efficacy, biocompatibility, and targeting of the MN system. The results indicate that the MN system has excellent physical properties, safety, effectiveness, biocompatibility, and strong targeting, which can act on HIF-1 and effectively inhibit the proliferation, migration, and intimal hyperplasia of SMC. The results showed that Vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced the incidence of POAF in CABG patients (RR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.76; Our updated pooled analysis concludes that Vitamin D reduces the incidence of POAF in CABG patients. Univariable analysis showed survival benefit in all patients with increased weight in comparison to normal weight group; with HR 0.776, 95% CI 0.675-0.891, Increased weight is associated with better long-term survival in patients after CABG, both in the overweight and obese patients. The primary endpoint is the change in the effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) of the mitral valve, which is obtained by echocardiography and calculated by subtracting the follow-up EROA from the preoperative EROA.

### 1. Preparation, Effect, and Mechanism Exploration of Hyaluronic Acid Microneedle Patch with Rapamycin Nanocrystals.
**Authors:** Xiaohang Ding, Bolin Wang, Longsheng Dai, Wenyuan Yu, Yuehua Zhao, Jiefang Sun, Yang Yu

**Abstract:** Transplant vein restenosis is the main complication affecting the long-term graft patency after coronary artery bypass grafting, mainly caused by VSMC proliferation and migration (initiating factors), leading to intimal hyperplasia and restenosis. Transplant vein restenosis has seriously affected the surgical efficacy of CABG, and the degree of transplant vein restenosis determines the patient's survival time. Therefore, a solution to this problem is urgent. Rapamycin is a cell cycle drug that can inhibit VSMC proliferation and migration but its systemic toxicity is high. In recent years, microneedle drug delivery systems have become a research hotspot with broad clinical application prospects. These systems are capable of achieving sustained, safe, and painless local drug release. In cardiovascular applications, MNs can maximize local drug effects and reduce systemic side effects. We speculate that the MN drug delivery system can be used to target transplanted veins, suppress restenosis by inhibiting SMC proliferation, reduce the incidence of restenosis after coronary artery bypass grafting, and delay the occurrence of restenosis. Therefore, this study developed a hyaluronic acid MN patch loaded with rapamycin and conducted preliminary physicochemical experiments. The study was conducted in in vitro and in vivo experiments using a jugular vein transplantation model to evaluate the safety, efficacy, biocompatibility, and targeting of the MN system. The results indicate that the MN system has excellent physical properties, safety, effectiveness, biocompatibility, and strong targeting, which can act on HIF-1 and effectively inhibit the proliferation, migration, and intimal hyperplasia of SMC. This provides a foundation for future research on inhibiting CABG restenosis throughout the entire process to ensure the patency of transplanted blood vessels.

**Authors:** Taimoor Ashraf, Muhammad Abdul Moiz, Ganesh Kumar, Akshay Kumar, Vishal Kumar, Vivek Anand, Fnu Sunita, Naresh Kumar Ladhwani, Tooba Hussain, Shah Dev, Muskan Turesh, Sadia Habib Bhutto, Umer Ejaz, Sayed Jawad

**Abstract:** To determine whether vitamin D supplementation reduces the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched from inception through May 2023 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of Vitamin D in preventing atrial fibrillation among postoperative patients after CABG. The primary outcome extracted was the incidence of atrial fibrillation after Vitamin D in CABG patients. Secondary outcome included the length of hospital stay. Data were pooled using a random-effect model. A total of 4 RCTs, including 694 patients, were included in the final analysis. The results showed that Vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced the incidence of POAF in CABG patients (RR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.76; Our updated pooled analysis concludes that Vitamin D reduces the incidence of POAF in CABG patients. Future large-scale studies should focus on more diverse patient populations and explore a broader range of outcomes to better understand the full impact of Vitamin D supplementation in this context.

**Authors:** Jarosław Bis, Paulina Kania-Olejnik, Kamil Padaż, Marcin Malinowski, Marek A Deja

**Abstract:** The obesity paradox in cardiac surgery suggests that obesity may be protective and associated with better survival after surgery. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of patients' body mass index (BMI) on late mortality after isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). All consecutive patients who underwent isolated CABG at our institution from 2014 to 2020 were included. Patients were divided into four groups according to (BMI): underweight (BMI <20.0 kg/m The study population consisted of 6448 patients including 104 (1.6%), 1296 (20.1%), 2946 (45.7%), and 2102 (32.6%) in the consecutive study groups. Mean follow-up time was 4.69 ± 2.17 years. Overall 30-day mortality was 2.5%. Univariable analysis showed survival benefit in all patients with increased weight in comparison to normal weight group; with HR 0.776, 95% CI 0.675-0.891, Increased weight is associated with better long-term survival in patients after CABG, both in the overweight and obese patients.

### 4. Superficial parasternal intercostal plane blocks with liposomal bupivacaine did not significantly reduce opioid use after cardiac surgery: a randomized clinical trial.
**Authors:** Eric R Simon, Alysan Mallery, John Silva, Andreas de Biasi, Satoru Osaki, Bryan M Krause, Patrick Meyer

**Abstract:** Acute pain after cardiac surgery via median sternotomy is commonly managed with multimodal analgesia, but optimal regional techniques remain uncertain. Superficial parasternal intercostal plane (SPIP) blocks have shown promise for postoperative pain control, with the use of catheters extending these benefits up to three days. This study evaluated the efficacy of single-injection SPIP blocks with liposomal bupivacaine in reducing opioid consumption following cardiac surgery. In this prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled trial, 100 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting or valve surgery via median sternotomy were randomized to receive bilateral SPIP blocks with either a mixture of bupivacaine and liposomal bupivacaine or saline placebo prior to incision. The primary outcome was total opioid consumption in oral morphine milligram equivalents (MME) over the first 72 postoperative hours. Secondary outcomes included pain scores, time to extubation, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay and opioid use at 90 days. Total opioid consumption in the first 72 hours was not significantly different between groups (SPIP intervention: 165 (IQR 103-284) MME vs saline placebo: 205 (IQR 145-282) MME, p=0.30). Pain scores, extubation time, ICU and hospital length of stay, and opioid use at 90 days were also similar between groups. No serious adverse events were reported. Preincision bilateral SPIP blocks with a mixture of bupivacaine and liposomal bupivacaine did not significantly reduce opioid consumption or improve postoperative analgesic outcomes compared with saline placebo in cardiac surgical patients. These findings suggest that single-injection SPIP blocks with liposomal bupivacaine may not be as effective as repeated injections or catheters in cardiac surgical patients. Further studies should explore modifications to block techniques such as multilevel injections, the timing of the block relative to surgery, alternative local anesthetics, and strategies specifically targeting chest tube-related pain. NCT04928339.

### 8. The role of angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor in moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation after isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (ARNI-MIMIC): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
**Authors:** Xieraili Tiemuerniyazi, Lianxin Chen, Liaoming He, Ziang Yang, Shengkang Huang, Yifeng Nan, Yangwu Song, Xin Yuan, Zhan Hu, Dong Zhao, Wei Zhao, Wei Feng

**Abstract:** Debates have been existed regarding the treatment of moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). While it might have priority on reducing the risk of recurrent IMR, studies showed that concomitant mitral valve repair increases the risk of adverse outcomes, such as neurological events, as well as the in-hospital costs. In recent studies, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) was discovered to have potential benefit in reducing the severity of IMR. The ARNI-MIMIC is a randomized controlled clinical trial aiming to reduce the risk of recurrent IMR in isolated CABG patients. A total of 220 eligible patients with moderate IMR will be allocated into control (non-ARNI) and intervention (ARNI) groups in a 1:1 pattern after isolated CABG. Patients in the intervention group will be administered with continuous sacubitril/valsartan for 6 months postoperatively, while patients in the control group will receive guideline recommended therapy only. All of the patients will be invited to complete 6-month follow-up. The primary endpoint is the change in the effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) of the mitral valve, which is obtained by echocardiography and calculated by subtracting the follow-up EROA from the preoperative EROA. This trial aims to investigate the potential role of ARNI as compared to the control in moderate IMR patients undergoing isolated CABG. If ARNI is proven to reduce the risk of moderate IMR recurrence, patients will benefit from both improved life quality and decreased medical costs. ETHICS APPROVAL AND DISSEMINATION: The This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Fuwai Hospital on October 18th 2024, with an approval number of 2024-2446. The results of this trail will be disseminated through international academic conferences and publication in medical journals regardless of the study outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT06917664.
