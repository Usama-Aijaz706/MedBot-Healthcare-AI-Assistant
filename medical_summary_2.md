## 📌 Executive Summary
The dilemma of current treatments for symptomatic patients with portal hypertension is how to resolve the problems of the varices and hypersplenism simultaneously and meanwhile preserve the splenic function. This study followed 132 symptomatic patients with portal hypertension who underwent partial splenectomy and pericardial devascularization in the General Surgery Department of the Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital from 2016 to 2023. Partial Splenectomy and Pericardial Devascularization appears to be a safe and effective approach to treat symptomatic patients with Portal Hypertension, while preserving the potential function of the spleen. Current allocation policy in the US restricts transplant to patients with early HCC, and priority for transplant is granted after 6 months on the waitlist, thus patients often require therapies for cancer control while awaiting liver transplantation. While there has been concern for rejection with the administration of immunotherapy prior to liver transplantation, early data suggest that the risk can be minimized with sufficient washout time prior to liver transplantation. Our findings highlight the need for future clinical and basic research into the diagnostic performance of depression screening tests and the phenomenology of depression in patients with DC. As the liver transplant community works to expand and standardize the living donor evaluation, it is imperative that we consider the unique risk stratification considerations for this marginalized population.

### 1. Treatment of Pruritus With Maralixibat in Early-Stage Chronic Graft Dysfunction of a Child With Alagille Syndrome.
**Authors:** Rainer Ganschow, Alexander Weigert, David Katzer

**Abstract:** Alagille syndrome (ALGS) is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by cholestasis and progressive liver disease that can lead to liver transplantation or death. Liver transplant recipients with ALGS can face chronic graft dysfunction and refractory pruritus that significantly impairs quality of life. We present the case of a 16-year-old male patient with ALGS who developed severe pruritus 13 years after receiving a liver transplant. Despite conventional therapies, his symptoms persisted, accompanied by elevated serum bile acids. Treatment with maralixibat, an ileal bile acid transporter inhibitor, resulted in complete resolution of pruritus within two months as well as a substantial reduction in serum bile acids. No adverse events were reported. This case offers real-world evidence of the effectiveness of maralixibat in managing cholestatic pruritus in a patient with ALGS and early-stage chronic graft dysfunction, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic option in this challenging patient population.

**Authors:** Yongseop Lee, Eun-Ki Min, Jae In Kim, Jaeeun Seong, Deok-Gie Kim, Dong Jin Joo, Myoung Soo Kim, Jae Geun Lee, Su Jin Jeong

**Abstract:** Hypogammaglobulinemia (HGG) is a common complication of liver transplantation (LT). However, the impact of underlying liver disease severity on post-LT immunoglobulin dynamics remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the differences in serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels based on the pre-transplantation model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores. We collected data from patients who underwent LT between July 2016 and December 2022 at a tertiary hospital. Propensity score matching was performed between the low and high MELD groups and IgG dynamics were evaluated. The significance of peri-LT HGG on clinical outcomes was also evaluated. In a matched population (1:1 propensity score matching), the median serum IgG levels decreased significantly from 1,606.5 mg/dL pre-LT to 1,011.6 mg/dL 1-month post-LT. IgG levels before and after transplantation (1 month, 6 months, and 1 year) did not differ significantly between the groups. Overall, 36.0% of patients developed HGG within 1 year after transplantation. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that pre-LT HGG was independently associated with mortality. In conclusion, HGG is frequent complication in peri-LT period and pre-LT HGG is significantly associated with mortality. No significant difference in HGG according to the MELD score was observed.

### 3. Partial splenectomy and pericardial devascularization for symptomatic patients with portal hypertension: a single-center retrospective study.
**Authors:** Ying Zhang, Shengzhi Wang, Jinghui Yang, Jinxiang Bu, Feng Liang

**Abstract:** The dilemma of current treatments for symptomatic patients with portal hypertension is how to resolve the problems of the varices and hypersplenism simultaneously and meanwhile preserve the splenic function. Partial splenectomy and pericardial devascularization is a potential alternative to currently used approaches, but it is incompletely defined. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of partial splenectomy and pericardial devascularization. This study followed 132 symptomatic patients with portal hypertension who underwent partial splenectomy and pericardial devascularization in the General Surgery Department of the Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital from 2016 to 2023. Clinical, laboratory, endoscopic examination and imaging data were collected and compared between preoperative and postoperative levels at intervals using a mixed linear model. All 132 patients with portal hypertension successfully underwent partial splenectomy and pericardial devascularization without intraoperative uncontrolled massive bleeding or death. Leucocyte and platelet counts increased to normal levels at intervals from 1 year to ≥ 4 years postoperatively. Among the patients followed for six months postoperatively, 23 (52.27%) showed improvement in esophagogastric varices, 19 (43.18%) had no significant changes in their condition, and 2 (4.55%) experienced worsening of the varices. At subsequent follow-ups, the majority of patients either showed improvements or no change in their esophagogastric varices, with only a small fraction experiencing worsening of the condition. The splenic remnant survived in most patients, and regrowth was very limited postoperatively, while 13 (9.85%) patients splenic remnant necrosis during follow-up. Liver failure was observed in 5 (3.79%) patients postoperatively, and 3 (2.27%) of them died perioperatively. Portal vein thrombosis was found in 90 (75%) patients the 7th days after surgery. With the progression of follow-up time, the proportion of patients with postoperative portal vein system thrombosis decreased over time. 3 (2.27%) patients experienced postoperative abdominal bleeding, which improved after emergency surgery for hemostasis. Partial Splenectomy and Pericardial Devascularization appears to be a safe and effective approach to treat symptomatic patients with Portal Hypertension, while preserving the potential function of the spleen.

### 4. Management of hepatocellular carcinoma prior to liver transplantation: latest developments.
**Authors:** Antoine Robert, Thomas M Hunold, Neehar D Parikh

**Abstract:** Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly morbid malignancy that is a leading cause of death in patients with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B. Liver transplantation is considered a curative therapy for HCC, with 5-year survival rates exceeding 75%. Current allocation policy in the US restricts transplant to patients with early HCC, and priority for transplant is granted after 6 months on the waitlist, thus patients often require therapies for cancer control while awaiting liver transplantation. The most commonly applied therapies for HCC in patients awaiting liver transplantation are locoregional therapies, including ablative, radiation, and arterial based therapies. Using these therapies patient can be effectively bridged or downstaged to liver transplantation, however there are risks of progressive liver decompensation with locoregional therapies in patients with portal hypertension. There are emerging data for the use of immune checkpoint inhibitor-based immunotherapies in the treatment of HCC. While there has been concern for rejection with the administration of immunotherapy prior to liver transplantation, early data suggest that the risk can be minimized with sufficient washout time prior to liver transplantation. Herein we aim to review management strategies for patients with HCC awaiting liver transplantation.

### 5. CO-PERK-IRG1 axis attenuates oxidative stress and ferroptosis in hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury.
**Authors:** Jeongmin Park, Min Zheng, Jeong Heon Gong, LiHua Jin, Stefan W Ryter, Yeonsoo Joe, Hun Taeg Chung

**Abstract:** Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) can arise as the consequence of surgical procedures, including liver transplant. Hepatic IRI is characterized by oxidative stress, inflammation, and activation of multiple regulated cell death pathways (RCD). Among RCD, ferroptosis is driven by enhanced lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Carbon monoxide (CO), which can exert cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties, can mitigate IRI in various pre-clinical models when applied at low concentration, though the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we describe a critical role of protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) signaling in the protective effects of CO against oxidative stress and ferroptosis. We demonstrate that CO-induced PERK activation phosphorylates Nrf2, a master regulator of the cellular antioxidant response, leading to upregulation of immune-responsive gene 1 (IRG1) expression in both Kupffer cells (KCs) and hepatocytes. IRG1-derived itaconate production suppressed ROS accumulation and ferroptosis by enhancing GPX4 levels, while reducing ACSL4 and PTGS2 expression. Genetic interference of PERK or Nrf2 using siRNA or knockout mice abolished CO-mediated IRG1 induction and protection against ferroptosis, highlighting the indispensable role of this pathway. Furthermore, in an in vivo model of hepatic IRI, CO treatment significantly reduced inflammation, histopathological damage, and ferroptosis in a manner dependent on the PERK-Nrf2-IRG1 axis. These findings establish the PERK-Nrf2-IRG1-itaconate pathway as a novel therapeutic target for hepatic IRI and potentially other ferroptosis-driven conditions.

**Authors:** Hasret Ayyıldız Civan, Ferhat Sarı, Feyza Sönmez Topçu, Aysel Taktak, Hüseyin İlksen, Adem Tunçer, Emrah Şahin, Halil Şahin, Veysel Esan, Bülent Ünal, Abuzer Dirican

**Abstract:** Liver transplantation is currently the most treatment for fulminant hepatitis, end-stage liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-originated metabolic diseases in children. With technological advances, improvements in surgical techniques and immunosuppressive therapy protocols have increased 1-year survival rates to 80%-90%. Our center successfully performs both living donor and cadaveric liver transplants in children. This study retrospectively analyzed the preoperative and postoperative data of 72 pediatric patients who underwent liver transplantation between July 2022 and July 2024. We included 72 patients who underwent liver transplantation between July 1, 2022, and July 1, 2024. Cases were evaluated based on demographic data, liver failure etiology, and postoperative complications. Of the cases, 37 were female (58%) and 35 male (42%), with a mean age of 6.6 years (ranging from 5 months to 17 years and 11 months). Indications included biliary atresia (25), autoimmune hepatitis (9), cryptogenic cirrhosis (7), PFIC (7), congenital hepatic fibrosis (1), Caroli disease (2), Wilson's disease (4), Alagille syndrome (3), hepatocellular carcinoma (2), primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (2), Crigler Najjar syndrome type 1 (3), Budd-Chiari syndrome (1), glycogen storage disease type 3 (1), portal vein thrombosis (1), and acute fulminant hepatitis (4). Mean PELD score for patients under 12 years was 18 (range 0-37), and MELD score for patients over 12 years was 19.3 (range 11-40). A total of 69 patients received orthotopic liver transplantation from living donors. Two patients received combined liver and kidney transplants, and 1 received a cadaveric liver transplant. Donors included 40 females and 32 males. Left lobe transplants were performed in 58 patients, and right lobe in 14. Immunosuppression included Tacrolimus + MMF in 70 patients and Cyclosporine in 2. Postoperative complications included biliary anastomosis stenosis (3), bile leakage (2), hepatic vein thrombosis (1), portal vein thrombosis (4), intestinal perforation secondary to Bogota syndrome (5), PRES syndrome due to Tacrolimus toxicity (1), primary graft dysfunction (1), and postoperative bleeding (2). Within the first month, 12 patients (16.6%) died, and 3 (4%) died between 1 month and 1 year postoperatively. The most common early cause of death was sepsis and multiorgan failure. One patient developed chronic rejection but recovered with steroid immunosuppression without the need for re-transplantation. Liver transplantation is a high-risk procedure requiring lifelong medication and follow-up. It is, however, the most effective treatment method for several severe pediatric liver conditions.

### 7. Differential Item Functioning of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 in Decompensated Cirrhosis.
**Authors:** Nneka N Ufere, Chengbo Zeng, Daniel Shalev, Andrea L Pusic, Kurt Kroenke, Maria Edelen

**Abstract:** We examined whether the symptom expression of depression as assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) depression screening tool differs between patients with decompensated cirrhosis (DC) compared to primary care patients. Study included 218 DC patients (91% Child-Pugh Class B/C) recruited from a liver transplant center and a real-world cohort of 436 outpatients from four primary care clinics in a large tertiary academic health system who completed the PHQ-9. We calculated positive screening rates for depression (PHQ-9 cutoff score of 10) for both cohorts. We evaluated PHQ-9 items for differential item functioning (DIF) in both cohorts within an Item Response Theory (IRT) framework. We compared DIF-adjusted and unadjusted IRT scores to characterize the impact of DIF on PHQ-9 total scores. Positive screening rates using a PHQ-9 cutoff score of 10 were 39% and 30% for DC and primary care patients respectively. Three PHQ-9 somatic symptom items (sleep problems, low energy, psychomotor agitation or retardation) showed significant DIF, with DC more likely than primary care patients with similar levels of depression severity to endorse these symptoms. DIF-adjusted scores suggested a one-point increase (PHQ-9 cutoff score of 11) in the screening threshold for DC patients. Equating for depression severity, we found differences in the symptom expression of depression for DC patients relative to primary care patients. Our findings highlight the need for future clinical and basic research into the diagnostic performance of depression screening tests and the phenomenology of depression in patients with DC.

### 8. Evaluation of living liver donors identifying as transgender or gender diverse.
**Authors:** Tzu-Hao Lee, Thanh Nguyen, Rita S Lee, Whitney E Jackson

**Abstract:** Transgender and gender diverse individuals face barriers to accessing equitable healthcare. As the liver transplant community works to expand and standardize the living donor evaluation, it is imperative that we consider the unique risk stratification considerations for this marginalized population. Herein, we review the nuances unique to psychosocial and medical considerations, including gender-affirming hormone therapy and perioperative management, with a focus on creating an inclusive environment.
