## ðŸ“Œ Executive Summary
We present results for first-line allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of an HLA-matched sibling donor, which we denote as the MSD-HSCT group, versus first-line treatment with ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin, which we denote as the immunosuppressive therapy group in the following section.The pooled hazard ratio for overall mortality for the MSD-HSCT group versus the immunosuppressive therapy group was 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.43 to 2.12, P = 0.90, low quality evidence). Given the high risk of bias, small number of trials and participants, and concerns about applicability, we downgraded our assessments of the quality of the evidence using the GRADE tool.Due to the very low-quality of the evidence base, we are uncertain about the effect of exercise-based CR on all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 5.67; 195 participants; 3 studies; very low-quality evidence), acute myocardial infarction (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.63; 254 participants; 3 studies; very low-quality evidence) and cardiovascular-related hospital admissions (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.1; 101 participants; 1 study; very low-quality evidence). We aimed to: evaluate the relative and absolute effects of different antibody preparations (except IL2Ra) when used as induction therapy in kidney transplant recipients; determine how the benefits and adverse events vary for each antibody preparation; determine how the benefits and harms vary for different formulations of antibody preparation; and determine whether the benefits and harms vary in specific subgroups of recipients (e.g. Meta-analysis was only possible for the primary morphological outcome (post-operative cephalic index).Morphological (cephalic index):At one year follow-up, post-operatively remodeling offers an advantage over craniectomy (Z = 4.16, P<0.0001)Morphological:Improvements of the cephalic index to varying degrees were seen in patients receiving either procedure and there is not enough evidence to suggest that either treatment group had greater improvement over the other.Functional and neurological:Although their global scores may be comparable to an age-matched population, patients with sagittal synostosis who have undergone a surgical repair of any type may have discrepancies in specific domains and may be at risk of developing learning disorders. Through an internal selection process, MarkVCID has identified a panel of 11 candidate biomarker "kits" (consisting of the biomarker measure and the clinical and cognitive data used to validate it) and established a range of harmonized procedures and protocols for participant enrollment, clinical and cognitive evaluation, collection and handling of fluid samples, acquisition of neuroimaging studies, and biomarker validation. Neuroimaging protocols." The procedures described here address a range of challenges in MarkVCID's design, notably: (1) acquiring all data under informed consent and enrollment procedures that allow unlimited sharing and open-ended analyses without compromising participant privacy rights; (2) acquiring the data in a sufficiently wide range of study participants to allow assessment of candidate biomarkers across the various patient groups who might ultimately be targeted in VCID clinical trials; (3) defining a common dataset of clinical and cognitive elements that contains all the key outcome markers and covariates for VCID studies and is realistically obtainable during a practical study visit; (4) instituting best fluid-handling practices for minimizing avoidable sources of variability; and (5) establishing rigorous procedures for testing the reliability of candidate fluid-based biomarkers across replicates, assay runs, sites, and time intervals (collectively defined as the biomarker's instrumental validity). Due to the difficulty to test such an association in randomized controlled studies, the studies included in the reviews were mainly observational studies: however, the quality of the available evidence can be considered good both for the consistency of the results between the studies and for the strength of the association.

### 1. Donor-Derived Cell-Free DNA as a Marker for the Efficacy of Daratumumab in Patients With Antibody-Mediated Rejection Post-Heart Transplantation: A Case Series.
**Authors:** Anusha Konduri, Kathryn E Flynn, Ashley Huebschman, Bronwyn Crandall, Natalie Sinicropi, Bethany Giacobbe, Mary Zamberlan, Matthew Najor, Matthew Cusick, Heang M Lim, Amanda D McCormick, Kurt R Schumacher, David M Peng

**Abstract:** Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) remains a significant complication following heart transplantation, contributing to graft dysfunction and reduced survival. Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) is emerging as a non-invasive biomarker for detecting and monitoring graft injury, correlating with episodes of rejection and response to treatment. Daratumumab, an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody targeting plasma cells, has shown promise in treating AMR. We present a case series of pediatric and young adult heart transplant recipients demonstrating donor-derived cell-free DNA's potential utility in monitoring for AMR and the effect of therapies including daratumumab. We report five cases showing that elevated dd-cfDNA correlated with pathological AMR (pAMR), and treatment with daratumumab improved both pAMR and dd-cfDNA levels. Most of our patients had persistently elevated donor-specific antibody (DSA) as observed by MFI values; however, there was a reduction in DSA titer that corresponded with improvement in pAMR and dd-cfDNA levels. Recurrent increases in dd-cfDNA were also useful in guiding the need for repeat treatment with daratumumab. Although DSA levels often remained elevated despite histologic improvement, decreasing dd-cfDNA levels correlated more closely with the resolution of AMR. In this case series of pediatric and young adult heart transplant recipients, our findings suggest that dd-cfDNA can serve as a valuable biomarker for diagnosing AMR and treatment response, which are not often reflected by DSA MFI alone. Our dd-cfDNA data supports the efficacy of daratumumab in treating AMR and may guide the need for ongoing treatment. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and establish guidance for the use of daratumumab and dd-cfDNA in this patient population.

**Abstract:** Little is known regarding the travel practices of thoracic organ transplant recipients and their potential associated morbidity. A questionnaire was distributed to thoracic organ transplant recipients to capture demographics, risk perception, knowledge regarding vaccination, history of travel outside metropolitan France, pre-travel advice, health issues during travel outside Europe, and travel intentions in the following year. Comparisons were performed between travelers and non-travelers through univariable then multivariable logistic regression. 134 patients completed the survey (72% lung, 11% heart, and 17% heart-lung transplant recipients). Twenty-four percent considered themselves at moderately to significantly increased risk of travel-related health issues. Sixty-two patients (47%) had traveled outside metropolitan France. Among 29 subjects who had traveled outside Europe, 22 had received pre-travel advice. Among 62 respondents who had traveled outside metropolitan France, 6 (10%) experienced health issues (all outside Europe), which led to consultation in three cases and hospitalization in one case. Among 117 respondents, 68 (58%) intended to travel within the following year, and 57 (84%) to seek medical advice before departure, predominantly from their transplant physician. In multivariable analysis, being a lung transplant recipient and higher education level were associated with travel outside Europe. The time post-transplantation was longer for all types of travel, when compared to non-travelers. Almost half of adult thoracic transplant recipients had traveled outside metropolitan France, 22% outside Europe, and 10% of travelers experienced health issues. The suboptimal preparation of these patients underlines the potential benefits of closer interaction between travel medicine specialists and transplant physicians.

**Authors:** Jia Xu, Cheng Deng, Tang Gao, Mengrong He, Wenpei Fu, Xin Zhang, Yin Bai, Jiani Qiu, Rui Wang, Yihan Chen, Qiaofeng Jin, Li Zhang, Qing Lv, Mingxing Xie, Wenqian Wu

**Abstract:** Chronic rejection (CR) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in heart transplantation survivors. The primary pathological features of CR encompass cardiac allograft vasculopathy and myocardial fibrosis. Currently, its diagnosis heavily relies on invasive procedures, underscoring the pressing need for non-invasive evaluation methods. This study introduces a novel approach utilizing mannose-modified microbubbles (MB

### 5. Nonischemic Cardiomyopathy in Adult-Onset PPA2-Deficient Mitochondrial Disease.
**Authors:** Emilie ThÃ©berge, Jillianne Code, John K Khoo, Chi Lai, Andrew Ignaszewski, Sean Virani, Mustafa Toma, Thomas M Roston, Tara Sedlak, Anna Lehman

**Abstract:** Nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) can be caused by single-gene mutations, including genes such as inorganic pyrophosphatase 2 (PPA2) with multisystem effects. A 28-year-old woman presenting with respiratory symptoms was discharged with a diagnosis of decompensated idiopathic NICM. Her NICM progressively worsened, and the patient underwent a heart transplant at the age of 38 and again at the age of 42. At age 47, genetic testing confirmed 2 mutations in the PPA2 gene that had caused her NICM. This patient is to our knowledge the oldest published to date (48 years) presenting with cardiac symptoms who has PPA2 deficiency, a mitochondrial disease characterized by sudden cardiac death in infancy. This case exemplifies the utility of employing genetic testing early in the diagnostic workup of NICM before applying the designation "idiopathic."

### 6. Cytomegalovirus Encephalitis in a Heart Transplant Recipient Presenting With Behavioral Changes and Functional Neurologic Deficits.
**Authors:** Rahi P Patel, Ashley Seymour, Steven Brady, Rami Kahwash

**Abstract:** Cytomegalovirus (CMV) encephalitis is a rare but serious complication in immunocompromised patients, particularly transplant recipients as they are heavily immunosuppressed. We report the first documented case to our knowledge of CMV encephalitis in a 67-year-old male heart transplant recipient, confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction. The patient presented with confusion and distinct behavioral changes, yet brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed no acute abnormalities. This case highlights the potential for CMV encephalitis to present with significant neurologic symptoms without any radiologic abnormalities, emphasizing the importance of molecular diagnostics in immunocompromised patients with unexplained neurologic deterioration. CMV encephalitis in transplant recipients can present with significant neurologic symptoms despite normal brain magnetic resonance imaging, necessitating cerebrospinal fluid analysis for timely diagnosis and management. Close monitoring of CMV viremia and neurologic status is critical, as clinical improvement may lag behind virologic clearance, necessitating individualized treatment strategies.

### 7. ABO-incompatible heart transplants in children aged 2-9 years: a new paradigm in transplant?
**Authors:** Paolo Hollis, Richard Issitt, Sebastiano A G Lava, Craig Laurence, Jacob Simmonds, Matthew Fenton, Nagarajan Muthialu, Alex Robertson, Richard Crook, Lori West, Michael Burch

**Abstract:** Paediatric heart transplantation remains hampered by the limited availability of donor organs. The introduction of ABO-incompatible (ABOi) heart transplantation for infants in the early 2000s expanded the donor pool for individual candidates. Nonetheless, concerns remain about ABOi heart transplantation in children aged over 2 years and it has not been routinely adopted. At our centre we have considered candidates aged 2-9 years for ABOi donors if isohaemagglutinin titres were 1:32 or less. We report the outcomes of those who received an ABOi heart transplant. Furthermore, as all transplant-listed children in this age group were tested for isohaemagglutinins, the potential for ABOi transplant was investigated. Data were retrospectively analysed from all paediatric heart transplants undertaken at our centre between 1st January 2013 and 1st June 2023. Primary outcome measures were anti-A and/or anti-B titres at listing and whether an ABOi transplant was performed. Secondary outcome measures were survival and incidence of rejection. 62 children 2 to 9 years of age (median age 5.1 years) underwent heart transplantation during the study period. One patient was blood group AB; of the remaining 61 patients, 51 had anti-A and/or anti-B titres measured whilst listed for transplant. Of these, 44 (86%) had isohaemagglutinin titres of 1:32 or less at the time of listing, and this dropped to 40 (78%) by the time of transplant. Over the study period, 14 children (age range 2.5-8.9 years, median 4.3 years) underwent ABOi transplant; all 14 patients were well at follow-up with median follow-up time of 4.9 years, range 1.7 to 8.9 years. Our data suggests that ABOi heart transplantation is a safe and effective option for older children, at least to 9 years of age. Furthermore, we have shown that the great majority of young children have isohaemagglutinin titres in the range that ABOi transplant could be considered. These findings may have a substantial impact on donor availability worldwide. Further work is needed to see if the age range can be extended further.

### 8. Predictors and Outcomes for Severe Primary Graft Dysfunction in Heart Transplantation: United States Cohort Analysis.
**Authors:** Peter D Cho, Hedwig Zappacosta, Joseph Song, John P White, Stephanie McKay, Donatello Telesca, Malini Daniel, Abbas Ardehali

**Abstract:** Severe Primary Graft Dysfunction (PGD) is the leading cause of early mortality in heart transplantation, yet national incidence, risk factors, and outcomes remain poorly characterized. This study aims to assess predictors and outcomes of severe PGD in a contemporary United States cohort. The United Network for Organ Sharing database was retrospectively reviewed for isolated adult heart transplant recipients (9/2023-3/2025). The population was stratified into severe PGD (left or bi-ventricular dysfunction within 24 hours following transplantation that requires mechanical circulatory support (MCS)) and Control cohorts (all other recipients). Predictors of severe PGD were identified using multivariable logistic regression. The severe PGD cohort was further classified into Transient severe Primary Graft Dysfunction (TPGD, MCS off by 72 hours) vs. Persistent severe Primary Graft Dysfunction (PPGD, remained on MCS at 72 hours). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare 3-month survival between groups. During the study interval, 5,097 heart transplant recipients were identified in the US, with 6.6% (n=338) developing severe PGD. Predictors for severe PGD included pre-transplant extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 2.55, p<0.001), hearts from donation after circulatory death (AOR: 2.13, p<0.001), donor acidemia prior to procurement (AOR: 2.01, p<0.001), recipient history of sternotomy (AOR: 1.83, p<0.001), and increased donor heart ischemic time (AOR: 1.18 per hour, p<0.001). The severe PGD group experienced lower 3-month survival than the Control group (74.4% vs 96.8%, p<0.001). Among severe PGD cases, 36.7% (n=124) experienced TPGD. Recipients with TPGD had a higher 3-month survival than those with PPGD (88.0% vs 67.2%, p<0.001). Severe PGD following heart transplantation is associated with high early mortality. A substantial proportion of severe PGD cases demonstrate early graft recovery. Consideration of risk factors in donor and recipient matching may mitigate the incidence of severe PGD.

### 9. Clinical and pathological analysis of 17 cases of mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma.
**Authors:** Biqian Kang, Bo Han, Danhua Shen, Guo Zhang, Xiaobo Zhang

**Abstract:** Mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma (MLA) is a rare gynecological malignancyï¼Œduring diagnosis, it is frequently mistaken for other gynecological malignancies because different development patterns coexist under a microscope. This study aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the disease by analyzing the clinical and pathological characteristics, immunohistochemistry, and molecular features of MLA. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 17 patients with mesonephric-like adenocarcinomadiagnosed by the Department of Pathology at Peking University People's Hospital from January 2021 to June 2025. The lesions were subjected to HE staining and immunohistochemical staining, and 10 cases were examined for gene mutations by next generation sequencing. The results of HE staining, immunohistochemical staining, and molecular testing were examined, along with the clinical information and histological characteristics. The age of the patients ranged from 49 to 83 years (median age 62.3 years), with 3 cases occurred in the ovaries and 14 cases in the uterus. 7 patients presented with (postmenopausal) irregular vaginal bleeding, 3 patient was diagnosed with ovarian or endometrial mass detected by ultrasound during a physical examination, 1 patient was diagnosed with complex endometrial hyperplasia during a hysteroscopy, 1 patient was diagnosed after further examination due to an elevated CA199 level, and 1 patient presented with pain from a liver metastasis. The initial symptoms of the remaining 4 cases referred from other hospitals were unknown. The tumor sizes ranged from 1.3â€¯Ã—â€¯0.8â€¯Ã—â€¯0.5â€¯cm to 8.3â€¯Ã—â€¯7.1â€¯Ã—â€¯4â€¯cm, with solid or cystic-solid growth patterns. Immunohistochemistry showed that 12 cases had negative expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR). 13 cases showed an inverse expression relationship between TTF-1 and GATA-3. 12 cases showed patchy positive expression for P16, 10 cases had CD10 positive expression at the luminal edge, and 15 cases had P53 expression that was wild-type. 9 of the 10 patients who had genetic testing had mutations in the KRAS gene at codon 12, 3 had mutations in the PTEN gene, 2 had mutations in the CTNNB1, 1 had a TP53 mutation, 1 had a PIK3CA mutation, 1 had a CCND1 mutation, 1 had a CDK6 mutation, 1 had a BCL2L11 mutation, and 1 had a non-specific molecular profile (NSMP). Mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma is a rare type of gynecologic malignant tumor. Because of its complex histomorphology, pathologists have to distinguish it from other gynecological tumors during diagnosis. The expression of TTF-1, GATA-3, and CD10 in immunohistochemistry can assist the diagnosis. Apart from immunohistochemical indicators, MLA is frequently linked to gene mutations like KRAS, TP53, and CTNNB1, which can aid pathologists in their diagnosis. MLA can spread to distant locations such the pelvis, liver, spleen, and colon, and it has a bad prognosis. To enable patients to obtain additional treatment in a timely way, pathologists must improve the diagnostic accuracy of this disease. An uncommon form of gynecological cancer, Mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma was added to the World Health Organization's (WHO) 5th edition of the classification of cancers of the female reproductive system in 2020. In regular clinical practice, it is comparatively rare. We gathered 17 Mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma cases for this study and compiled the clinical data, such as patient age at onset, initial symptoms, surgical techniques, recurrence or prognosis, and histopathological features like immunohistochemical expression, molecular features, and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining characteristics.The aim is to raise pathologists' awareness of this uncommon illness, avoid missing or incorrect diagnosis throughout the diagnostic process.

### 10. Taxane monotherapy regimens for the treatment of recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer.
**Authors:** Aashna Patel, Roshni Kalachand, Steven Busschots, Ben Doherty, Evangelos Kapros, Denise Lawlor, Neville Hall, Britta K Stordal

**Abstract:** Ovarian cancer is the seventh most frequent cancer diagnosis worldwide, and the eighth leading cause of cancer mortality. Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most common kind, accounting for 90% of cases. First-line therapy for women with epithelial ovarian cancer consists of a combination of cytoreductive surgery and platinum and taxane-based chemotherapy. However, more than 50% of women with epithelial ovarian cancer will experience a relapse and require further chemotherapy and at some point develop resistance to platinum-based drugs. Currently, guidance on the use of most chemotherapy drugs, including taxanes, is unclear for women whose epithelial ovarian cancer has recurred. Paclitaxel, topotecan, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, trabectedin and gemcitabine are all licensed for use in the UK at the discretion of clinicians, following discussion with the women as to potential adverse effects. Taxanes can be given in once-weekly regimens (at a lower dose) or three-weekly regimens (at a higher dose), which may have differences in the severity of side effects and effectiveness. As relapsed disease suggests incurable disease, it is all the more important to consider side effects and the impact of treatment schedules, as well as quality of life, and not only the life-prolonging effects of treatment. To assess the efficacy and toxicity of different taxane monotherapy regimens for women with recurrent epithelial ovarian, tubal or primary peritoneal cancer. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase, up to 22 March 2022. Other related databases and trial registries were searched as well as grey literature and no additional studies were identified. A total of 1500 records were identified. We included randomised controlled trials of taxane monotherapy for adult women diagnosed with recurrent epithelial ovarian, tubal or primary peritoneal cancer, previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. We included trials comparing two or more taxane monotherapy regimens. Participants could be experiencing their first recurrence of disease or any line of recurrence. Two review authors screened, independently assessed studies, and extracted data from the included studies. The clinical outcomes we examined were overall survival, response rate, progression-free survival, neurotoxicity, neutropenia, alopecia, and quality of life. We performed statistical analyses using fixed-effect and random-effects models following standard Cochrane methodology. We rated the certainty of evidence according to the GRADE approach. Our literature search yielded 1500 records of 1466 studies; no additional studies were identified by searching grey literature or handsearching. We uploaded the search results into Covidence. After the exclusion of 92 duplicates, we screened titles and abstracts of 1374 records. Of these, we identified 24 studies for full-text screening. We included four parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs). All trials were multicentred and conducted in a hospital setting. The studies included 981 eligible participants with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, tubal or primary peritoneal cancer with a median age ranging between 56 to 62 years of age. All participants had a WHO (World Health Organization) performance status of between 0 to 2. The proportion of participants with serous histology ranged between 56% to 85%. Participants included women who had platinum-sensitive (71%) and platinum-resistant (29%) relapse. Some participants were taxane pre-treated (5.6%), whilst the majority were taxane-naive (94.4%). No studies were classified as having a high risk of bias for any of the domains in the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We found that there may be little or no difference in overall survival (OS) between weekly paclitaxel and three-weekly paclitaxel, but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) of 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 1.33, two studies, 263 participants, very low-certainty evidence). Similarly, there may be little or no difference in response rate (RR of 1.07, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.48, two studies, 263 participants, very low-certainty evidence) and progression-free survival (PFS) (RR of 0.83, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.52, two studies, 263 participants, very low-certainty evidence) between weekly and three-weekly paclitaxel, but the evidence is very uncertain. We found differences in the chemotherapy-associated adverse events between the weekly and three-weekly paclitaxel regimens. The weekly paclitaxel regimen may result in a reduction in neutropenia (RR 0.51, 95% 0.27 to 0.95, two studies, 260 participants, low-certainty evidence) and alopecia (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.73, one study, 205 participants, low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in neurotoxicity, but the evidence was very low-certainty and we cannot exclude an effect (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.45, two studies, 260 participants). When examining the effect of paclitaxel dosage in the three-weekly regimen, the 250 mg/m Fewer people may experience neutropenia when given weekly rather than three-weekly paclitaxel (low-certainty evidence), although it may make little or no difference to the risk of developing neurotoxicity (very low-certainty evidence). This is based on the participants receiving lower doses of drug more often. However, our confidence in this result is low and the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Weekly paclitaxel probably reduces the risk of alopecia, although the rates in both arms were high (46% versus 79%) (low-certainty evidence). A change to weekly from three-weekly chemotherapy could be considered to reduce the likelihood of toxicity, as it may have little or no negative impact on response rate (very low-certainty evidence), PFS (very low-certainty evidence) or OS (very low-certainty evidence). Three-weekly paclitaxel, given at a dose of 175 mg/m

### 11. Calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal or tapering for kidney transplant recipients.
**Authors:** Krishna M Karpe, Girish S Talaulikar, Giles D Walters

**Abstract:** Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) can reduce acute transplant rejection and immediate graft loss but are associated with significant adverse effects such as hypertension and nephrotoxicity which may contribute to chronic rejection. CNI toxicity has led to numerous studies investigating CNI withdrawal and tapering strategies. Despite this, uncertainty remains about minimisation or withdrawal of CNI. This review aimed to look at the benefits and harms of CNI tapering or withdrawal in terms of graft function and loss, incidence of acute rejection episodes, treatment-related side effects (hypertension, hyperlipidaemia) and death. We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 11 October 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE; handsearching conference proceedings; and searching the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where drug regimens containing CNI were compared to alternative drug regimens (CNI withdrawal, tapering or low dose) in the post-transplant period were included, without age or dosage restriction. Two authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, risk of bias, and extracted data. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We included 83 studies that involved 16,156 participants. Most were open-label studies; less than 30% of studies reported randomisation method and allocation concealment. Studies were analysed as intent-to-treat in 60% and all pre-specified outcomes were reported in 54 studies. The attrition and reporting bias were unclear in the remainder of the studies as factors used to judge bias were reported inconsistently. We also noted that 50% (47 studies) of studies were funded by the pharmaceutical industry.We classified studies into four groups: CNI withdrawal or avoidance with or without substitution with mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTOR-I); and low dose CNI with or without mTOR-I. The withdrawal groups were further stratified as avoidance and withdrawal subgroups for major outcomes.CNI withdrawal may lead to rejection (RR 2.54, 95% CI 1.56 to 4.12; moderate certainty evidence), may make little or no difference to death (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.24; moderate certainty), and probably slightly reduces graft loss (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98; low quality evidence). Hypertension was probably reduced in the CNI withdrawal group (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.95; low certainty), while CNI withdrawal may make little or no difference to malignancy (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.30; low certainty), and probably makes little or no difference to cytomegalovirus (CMV) (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.45; low certainty)CNI avoidance may result in increased acute rejection (RR 2.16, 95% CI 0.85 to 5.49; low certainty) but little or no difference in graft loss (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.16; low certainty). Late CNI withdrawal increased acute rejection (RR 3.21, 95% CI 1.59 to 6.48; moderate certainty) but probably reduced graft loss (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97, low certainty).Results were similar when CNI avoidance or withdrawal was combined with the introduction of mTOR-I; acute rejection was probably increased (RR 1.43; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.78; moderate certainty) and there was probably little or no difference in death (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.36, moderate certainty). mTOR-I substitution may make little or no difference to graft loss (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.19; low certainty), probably makes little of no difference to hypertension (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.15; moderate), and probably reduced the risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.82; moderate certainty) and malignancy (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.00; low certainty). Lymphoceles were increased with mTOR-I substitution (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.21; low certainty).Low dose CNI combined with mTOR-I probably increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (MD 6.24 mL/min, 95% CI 3.28 to 9.119; moderate certainty), reduced graft loss (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.02; moderate certainty), and made little or no difference to acute rejection (RR 1.13 ; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.40; moderate certainty). Hypertension was decreased (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.20; low certainty) as was CMV (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.06; low certainty). Low dose CNI plus mTOR-I makes probably makes little of no difference to malignancy (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.53; low certainty) and may make little of no difference to death (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.90; moderate certainty). CNI avoidance increased acute rejection and CNI withdrawal increases acute rejection but reduced graft loss at least over the short-term. Low dose CNI with induction regimens reduced acute rejection and graft loss with no major adverse events, also in the short-term. The use of mTOR-I reduced CMV infections but increased the risk of acute rejection. These conclusions must be tempered by the lack of long-term data in most of the studies, particularly with regards to chronic antibody-mediated rejection, and the suboptimal methodological quality of the included studies.

### 12. Inhaled magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute asthma.
**Authors:** Rachel Knightly, Stephen J Milan, Rodney Hughes, Jennifer A Knopp-Sihota, Brian H Rowe, Rebecca Normansell, Colin Powell

**Abstract:** Asthma exacerbations can be frequent and range in severity from mild to life-threatening. The use of magnesium sulfate (MgSOâ‚„) is one of numerous treatment options available during acute exacerbations. While the efficacy of intravenous MgSOâ‚„ has been demonstrated, the role of inhaled MgSOâ‚„ is less clear. To determine the efficacy and safety of inhaled MgSOâ‚„ administered in acute asthma. to quantify the effects of inhaled MgSOâ‚„ I) in addition to combination treatment with inhaled Î²â‚‚-agonist and ipratropium bromide; ii) in addition to inhaled Î²â‚‚-agonist; and iii) in comparison to inhaled Î²â‚‚-agonist. We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials and online trials registries in September 2017. We supplemented these with searches of the reference lists of published studies and by contact with trialists. RCTs including adults or children with acute asthma were eligible for inclusion in the review. We included studies if patients were treated with nebulised MgSOâ‚„ alone or in combination with Î²â‚‚-agonist or ipratropium bromide or both, and were compared with the same co-intervention alone or inactive control. Two review authors independently assessed trial selection, data extraction and risk of bias. We made efforts to collect missing data from authors. We present results, with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for pulmonary function, clinical severity scores and vital signs; and risk ratios (RRs) for hospital admission. We used risk differences (RDs) to analyse adverse events because events were rare. Twenty-five trials (43 references) of varying methodological quality were eligible; they included 2907 randomised patients (2777 patients completed). Nine of the 25 included studies involved adults; four included adult and paediatric patients; eight studies enrolled paediatric patients; and in the remaining four studies the age of participants was not stated. The design, definitions, intervention and outcomes were different in all 25 studies; this heterogeneity made direct comparisons difficult. The quality of the evidence presented ranged from high to very low, with most outcomes graded as low or very low. This was largely due to concerns about the methodological quality of the included studies and imprecision in the pooled effect estimates. Inhaled magnesium sulfate in addition to inhaled Î²â‚‚-agonist and ipratropiumWe included seven studies in this comparison. Although some individual studies reported improvement in lung function indices favouring the intervention group, results were inconsistent overall and the largest study reporting this outcome found no between-group difference at 60 minutes (MD -0.3 % predicted peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), 95% CI -2.71% to 2.11%). Admissions to hospital at initial presentation may be reduced by the addition of inhaled magnesium sulfate (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.00; participants = 1308; studies = 4; IÂ² = 52%) but no difference was detected for re-admissions or escalation of care to ITU/HDU. Serious adverse events during admission were rare. There was no difference between groups for all adverse events during admission (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.05; participants = 1197; studies = 2). Inhaled magnesium sulfate in addition to inhaled Î²â‚‚-agonistWe included 13 studies in this comparison. Although some individual studies reported improvement in lung function indices favouring the intervention group, none of the pooled results showed a conclusive benefit as measured by FEV1 or PEFR. Pooled results for hospital admission showed a point estimate that favoured the combination of MgSOâ‚„ and Î²â‚‚-agonist, but the confidence interval includes the possibility of admissions increasing in the intervention group (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.15; participants = 375; studies = 6; IÂ² = 0%). There were no serious adverse events reported by any of the included studies and no between-group difference for all adverse events (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.03; participants = 694; studies = 5). Inhaled magnesium sulfate versus inhaled Î²â‚‚-agonistWe included four studies in this comparison. The evidence for the efficacy of Î²â‚‚-agonists in acute asthma is well-established and therefore this could be considered a historical comparison. Two studies reported a benefit of Î²â‚‚-agonist over MgSOâ‚„ alone for PEFR and two studies reported no difference; we did not pool these results. Admissions to hospital were only reported by one small study and events were rare, leading to an uncertain result. No serious adverse events were reported in any of the studies in this comparison; one small study reported mild to moderate adverse events but the result is imprecise. Treatment with nebulised MgSOâ‚„ may result in modest additional benefits for lung function and hospital admission when added to inhaled Î²â‚‚-agonists and ipratropium bromide, but our confidence in the evidence is low and there remains substantial uncertainty. The recent large, well-designed trials have generally not demonstrated clinically important benefits. Nebulised MgSOâ‚„ does not appear to be associated with an increase in serious adverse events. Individual studies suggest that those with more severe attacks and attacks of shorter duration may experience a greater benefit but further research into subgroups is warranted.Despite including 24 trials in this review update we were unable to pool data for all outcomes of interest and this has limited the strength of the conclusions reached. A core outcomes set for studies in acute asthma is needed. This is particularly important in paediatric studies where measuring lung function at the time of an exacerbation may not be possible. Placebo-controlled trials in patients not responding to standard maximal treatment, including inhaled Î²â‚‚-agonists and ipratropium bromide and systemic steroids, may help establish if nebulised MgSOâ‚„ has a role in acute asthma. However, the accumulating evidence suggests that a substantial benefit may be unlikely.

### 13. First-line allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of HLA-matched sibling donors compared with first-line ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin for acquired severe aplastic anemia.
**Authors:** Frank Peinemann, Carmen Bartel, Ulrich Grouven

**Abstract:** Acquired severe aplastic anemia is a rare and potentially fatal disease, which is characterized by hypocellular bone marrow and pancytopenia. The major signs and symptoms are severe infections, bleeding, and exhaustion. First-line allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor (MSD) is a treatment for newly diagnosed patients with severe aplastic anemia. First-line treatment with ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin (as first-line immunosuppressive therapy) is an alternative to MSD-HSCT and is indicated for patients where no MSD is found. To evaluate the effectiveness and adverse events of first-line allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of HLA-matched sibling donors compared to first-line immunosuppressive therapy including ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin in patients with acquired severe aplastic anemia. We searched the electronic databases MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), and The Cochrane Library CENTRAL (Wiley) for published articles from 1946 to 22 April 2013. Further searches included trial registries, reference lists of recent reviews, and author contacts. The following prospective study designs were eligible for inclusion: randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials if the allocation of patients to treatment groups was consistent with 'Mendelian randomization'. We included participants with newly diagnosed severe aplastic anemia who received MSD-HSCT or immunosuppressive therapy without prior HSCT or immunosuppressive therapy, and with a minimum of five participants per treatment group. We did not apply limits on publication year or languages. Two review authors abstracted the data on study and patient characteristics and assessed the risk of bias independently. We resolved differences by discussion or by appeal to a third review author. The primary outcome was overall mortality. Secondary outcomes were treatment-related mortality, graft failure, no response to first-line immunosuppressive therapy, graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), relapse after initial successful treatment, secondary clonal and malignant disease, health-related quality of life, and performance score. We identified three trials that met the inclusion criteria. None of these trials was a RCT. 302 participants are included in this review. The three included studies were prospectively conducted and had features consistent with the principle of 'Mendelian randomization' as defined in the present review. All studies had a high risk of bias due to the study design. All studies were conducted more than 10 years ago and may not be applicable to the standard of care of today. Primary and secondary outcome data showed no statistically significant difference between treatment groups. We present results for first-line allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of an HLA-matched sibling donor, which we denote as the MSD-HSCT group, versus first-line treatment with ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin, which we denote as the immunosuppressive therapy group in the following section.The pooled hazard ratio for overall mortality for the MSD-HSCT group versus the immunosuppressive therapy group was 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.43 to 2.12, P = 0.90, low quality evidence). Therefore, overall mortality was not statistically significantly different between the groups. Treatment-related mortality ranged from 20% to 42% for the MSD-HSCT group and was not reported for the immunosuppressive therapy group (very low quality evidence). The authors reported graft failure from 3% to 16% for the MSD-HSCT group and GVHD from 26% to 51% (both endpoints not applicable for the immunosuppressive therapy group, very low quality evidence). The authors did not report any data on response and relapse for the MSD-HSCT group. For the immunosuppressive therapy group, the studies reported no response from 15% (not time point stated) to 64% (three months) and relapse in one of eight responders after immunosuppressive therapy at 5.5 years (very low quality evidence). The authors reported secondary clonal disease or malignancies for the MSD-HSCT group versus the immunosuppressive therapy group in 1 of 34 versus 0 of 22 patients in one study and in 0 of 28 versus 4 of 86 patients in the other study (low quality evidence). None of the included studies addressed health-related quality of life. The percentage of the evaluated patients with a Karnofsky performance status score in the range of 71% to 100% was 92% in the MSD-HSCT group and 46% in the immunosuppressive therapy group. There are insufficient and biased data that do not allow any conclusions to be made about the comparative effectiveness of first-line allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of an HLA-matched sibling donor and first-line treatment with ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin (as first-line immunosuppressive therapy). We are unable to make firm recommendations regarding the choice of intervention for treatment of acquired severe aplastic anemia.

### 14. Quantifying Harms Associated With Red Cell ABO Incompatible Blood Transfusion: A Systematic Review of the UK SHOT Literature.
**Authors:** Florence Oyekan, Helinor McAleese, Montasir Ahmed, Cath Booth, Louise Bowles, Michael F Murphy, Florian Tomini, Laura Green, Josephine McCullagh

**Abstract:** ABO-incompatible (ABOi) red blood cell (RBC) transfusions can lead to severe clinical consequences, including patient death. Electronic systems, such as Bedside Electronic Transfusion Checks (BETC), have been developed to lower the risk of these serious incidents occurring due to errors in patient identification at the bedside; however, the benefits for patients have not yet been fully quantified. To address this gap, we aimed to quantify the harms (ie, morbidity and mortality) associated with ABOi RBC transfusions in the UK, enabling us to better understand the benefits of BETC in preventing these events for patients. Twenty-seven years of published UK hemovigilance data from cases submitted to Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT), including reports from 1996 to 2023 were reviewed using systematic review methodology by 2 independent reviewers. Data was collated into a Microsoft Excel database for further analysis. The data were analyzed to determine the number of reports of ABOi RBC transfusion and the rate of mortality/morbidity associated with these events. Morbidity was defined as hemolytic transfusion reaction (acute and delayed), any organ injury, extended length of hospital stays, the requirement for mechanical ventilation and ITU admission (including critical care units), and any other adverse events as reported in each case. Over 27 years (1996-2023), 55.3 million RBC units were issued in the UK, with 368 ABO-incompatible (ABOi) transfusions, equating to 0.67 per 100,000 transfusions. Clinical errors accounted for 53.3% of the observed ABOi transfusions (0.36 per 100,000), primarily occurring during administration (0.16 per 100,000), blood collection (0.10 per 100,000), and sample collection (0.07 per 100,000). Laboratory errors made up for 13.6% of the observed ABOi transfusions (0.09 per 100,000), predominantly being a consequence of errors in pretransfusion testing (0.06 per 100,000). Mortality among the observed ABOi transfusions was 6.3% (0.04 per 100,000), with major morbidity at 23.9% (0.16 per 100,000), which includes ICU admissions (0.03 per 100,000) and hemolytic reactions (0.05 per 100,000). While ABOi RBC transfusions have become rare in the UK, they are associated with significant short-term morbidity and mortality. Early SHOT reports lacked standardization and provide limited data on patient outcome. When patient outcome was reported, it was limited to short-term outcomes immediately post ABOi transfusions. No data was reported on longer -term patient outcomes limiting the ability to provide long-term outcome assessment. Enhancing hemovigilance practices is essential to reducing ABOi risks. National hemovigilance schemes worldwide need to harmonize/standardize the reporting of short-term and long-term outcome data collection for ABOi RBC transfusions so we can better understand the risk and burden of these events on patients.

### 16. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for adults with stable angina.
**Authors:** Linda Long, Lindsey Anderson, Alice M Dewhirst, Jingzhou He, Charlene Bridges, Manish Gandhi, Rod S Taylor

**Abstract:** A previous Cochrane review has shown that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) can benefit myocardial infarction and post-revascularisation patients. However, the impact on stable angina remains unclear and guidance is inconsistent. Whilst recommended in the guidelines of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology, in the UK the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) states that there is "no evidence to suggest that CR is clinically or cost-effective for managing stable angina". To assess the effects of exercise-based CR compared to usual care for adults with stable angina. We updated searches from the previous Cochrane review 'Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for patients with coronary heart disease' by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, DARE, CINAHL and Web of Science on 2 October 2017. We searched two trials registers, and performed reference checking and forward-citation searching of all primary studies and review articles, to identify additional studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least six months, which compared structured exercise-based CR with usual care for people with stable angina. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Two review authors also independently assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE principles and we presented this information in a 'Summary of findings' table. Seven studies (581 participants) met our inclusion criteria. Trials had an intervention length of 6 weeks to 12 months and follow-up length of 6 to 12 months. The comparison group in all trials was usual care (without any form of structured exercise training or advice) or a no-exercise comparator. The mean age of participants within the trials ranged from 50 to 66 years, the majority of participants being male (range: 74% to 100%). In terms of risk of bias, the majority of studies were unclear about their generation of the randomisation sequence and concealment processes. One study was at high risk of detection bias as it did not blind its participants or outcome assessors, and two studies had a high risk of attrition bias due to the numbers of participants lost to follow-up. Two trials were at high risk of outcome reporting bias. Given the high risk of bias, small number of trials and participants, and concerns about applicability, we downgraded our assessments of the quality of the evidence using the GRADE tool.Due to the very low-quality of the evidence base, we are uncertain about the effect of exercise-based CR on all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 5.67; 195 participants; 3 studies; very low-quality evidence), acute myocardial infarction (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.63; 254 participants; 3 studies; very low-quality evidence) and cardiovascular-related hospital admissions (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.1; 101 participants; 1 study; very low-quality evidence). We found low-quality evidence that exercise-based CR may result in a small improvement in exercise capacity compared to control (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.45, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.70; 267 participants; 5 studies, low-quality evidence). We were unable to draw conclusions about the impact of exercise-based CR on quality of life (angina frequency and emotional health-related quality-of-life score) and CR-related adverse events (e.g. skeletomuscular injury, cardiac arrhythmia), due to the very low quality of evidence. No data were reported on return to work. Due to the small number of trials and their small size, potential risk of bias and concerns about imprecision and lack of applicability, we are uncertain of the effects of exercise-based CR compared to control on mortality, morbidity, cardiovascular hospital admissions, adverse events, return to work and health-related quality of life in people with stable angina. Low-quality evidence indicates that exercise-based CR may result in a small increase in exercise capacity compared to usual care. High-quality, well-reported randomised trials are needed to assess the benefits and harms of exercise-based CR for adults with stable angina. Such trials need to collect patient-relevant outcomes, including clinical events and health-related quality of life. They should also assess cost-effectiveness, and recruit participants that are reflective of the real-world population of people with angina.

### 17. Barriers and facilitators to the implementation of lay health worker programmes to improve access to maternal and child health: qualitative evidence synthesis.
**Authors:** Claire Glenton, Christopher J Colvin, Benedicte Carlsen, Alison Swartz, Simon Lewin, Jane Noyes, Arash Rashidian

**Abstract:** Lay health workers (LHWs) perform functions related to healthcare delivery, receive some level of training, but have no formal professional or paraprofessional certificate or tertiary education degree. They provide care for a range of issues, including maternal and child health. For LHW programmes to be effective, we need a better understanding of the factors that influence their success and sustainability. This review addresses these issues through a synthesis of qualitative evidence and was carried out alongside the Cochrane review of the effectiveness of LHWs for maternal and child health. The overall aim of the review is to explore factors affecting the implementation of LHW programmes for maternal and child health. We searched MEDLINE, OvidSP (searched 21 December 2011); MEDLINE Ovid In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, OvidSP (searchedÂ 21 December 2011); CINAHL, EBSCO (searched 21 December 2011); British Nursing Index and Archive, OvidSP (searched 13 May 2011). We searched reference lists of included studies, contacted experts in the field, and included studies that were carried out alongside the trials from the LHW effectiveness review. Studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis and that focused on the experiences and attitudes of stakeholders regarding LHW programmes for maternal or child health in a primary or community healthcare setting. We identified barriers and facilitators to LHW programme implementation using the framework thematic synthesis approach. Two review authors independently assessed study quality using a standard tool. We assessed the certainty of the review findings using the CerQual approach, an approach that we developed alongside this and related qualitative syntheses. We integrated our findings with the outcome measures included in the review of LHW programme effectiveness in a logic model. Finally, we identified hypotheses for subgroup analyses in future updates of the review of effectiveness. We included 53 studies primarily describing the experiences of LHWs, programme recipients, and other health workers. LHWs in high income countries mainly offered promotion, counselling and support.Â In low and middle income countries, LHWs offered similar services but sometimes also distributed supplements, contraceptives and other products, and diagnosed and treated children with common childhood diseases. Some LHWs were trained to manage uncomplicated labour and to refer women with pregnancy or labour complications.Many of the findings were based on studies from multiple settings, but with some methodological limitations. These findings were assessed as being of moderate certainty. Some findings were based on one or two studies and had some methodological limitations. These were assessed have low certainty.Barriers and facilitators were mainly tied to programme acceptability, appropriateness and credibility; and health system constraints. Programme recipients were generally positive to the programmes, appreciating the LHWs' skills and the similarities they saw between themselves and the LHWs. However, some recipients were concerned about confidentiality when receiving home visits. Others saw LHW services as not relevant or not sufficient, particularly when LHWs only offered promotional services. LHWs and recipients emphasised the importance of trust, respect, kindness and empathy. However, LHWs sometimes found it difficult to manage emotional relationships and boundaries with recipients. Some LHWs feared blame if care was not successful. Others felt demotivated when their services were not appreciated. Support from health systems and community leaders could give LHWs credibility, at least if the health systems and community leaders had authority and respect. Active support from family members was also important.Health professionals often appreciated the LHWs' contributions in reducing their workload and for their communication skills and commitment. However, some health professionals thought that LHWs added to their workload and feared a loss of authority.LHWs were motivated by factors including altruism, social recognition, knowledge gain and career development.Â Some unsalaried LHWs wanted regular payment, while others were concerned that payment might threaten their social status or lead recipients to question their motives. Some salaried LHWs were dissatisfied with their pay levels. Others were frustrated when payment differed across regions or institutions. Some LHWs stated that they had few opportunities to voice complaints.Â LHWs described insufficient, poor quality, irrelevant and inflexible training programmes, calling for more training in counselling and communication and in topics outside their current role, including common health problems and domestic problems.Â LHWs and supervisors complained about supervisors' lack of skills, time and transportation. Some LHWs appreciated the opportunity to share experiences with fellow LHWs.In some studies, LHWs were traditional birth attendants who had received additional training. Some health professionals were concerned that these LHWs were over-confident about their ability to manage danger signs. LHWs and recipients pointed to other problems, including women's reluctance to be referred after bad experiences with health professionals, fear of caesarean sections, lack of transport, and cost. Some LHWs were reluctant to refer women on because of poor co-operation with health professionals.We organised these findings and the outcome measures included in the review of LHW programme effectiveness in a logic model. Here we proposed six chains of events where specific programme components lead to specific intermediate or long-term outcomes, and where specific moderators positively or negatively affect this process. We suggest how future updates of the LHW effectiveness review could explore whether the presence of these components influences programme success. Rather than being seen as a lesser trained health worker, LHWs may represent a different and sometimes preferred type of health worker.Â The close relationship between LHWs and recipients is a programme strength. However, programme planners must consider how to achieve the benefits of closeness while minimizing the potential drawbacks. Other important facilitators may include the development of services that recipients perceive as relevant; regular and visible support from the health system and the community; and appropriate training, supervision and incentives.

### 18. Dorsal Subluxation of the First Metacarpal During Thumb Flexion is an Indicator of Carpometacarpal Osteoarthritis Progression.
**Authors:** Amy M Morton, Douglas C Moore, Amy L Ladd, Arnold-Peter C Weiss, Janine Molino, Joseph J Crisco

**Abstract:** Measurable changes in patients with progression of thumb carpometacarpal (CMC) osteoarthritis (OA) include joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, subluxation, and adjacent-tissue changes. Subluxation, an indication of mechanical instability, is postulated as an early biomechanical indicator of progressing CMC OA. Various radiographic views and hand postures have been proposed to best assess CMC subluxation, but 3D measurements derived from CT images serve as the optimal metric. However, we do not know which thumb pose yields subluxation that most indicates OA progression. Using osteophyte volume as a quantitative measure of OA progression, we asked: (1) Does dorsal subluxation vary by thumb pose, time, and disease severity in patients with thumb CMC OA? (2) In which thumb pose(s) does dorsal subluxation most differentiate patients with stable CMC OA from those with progressing CMC OA? (3) In those poses, what values of dorsal subluxation indicate a high likelihood of CMC OA progression? Between 2011 and 2014, 743 patients were seen at our institutions for trapeziometacarpal pain. We considered individuals who were between the ages of 45 and 75 years, had tenderness to palpation or a positive grind test result, and had modified Eaton Stage 0 or 1 radiographic thumb CMC OA as potentially eligible for enrollment. Based on these criteria, 109 patients were eligible. Of the eligible patients, 19 were excluded because of a lack of interest in study participation, and another four were lost before the minimum study follow-up or had incomplete datasets, leaving 86 (43 female patients with a mean age of 53 Â± 6 years and 43 male patients with a mean age of 60 Â± 7 years) patients for analysis. Twenty-five asymptomatic participants (controls) aged 45 to 75 years were also prospectively recruited to participate in this study. Inclusion criteria for controls included an absence of thumb pain and no evidence of CMC OA during clinical examination. Of the 25 recruited controls, three were lost to follow-up, leaving 22 for analysis (13 female patients with a mean age of 55 Â± 7 years and nine male patients with a mean age of 58 Â± 9 years). Over the 6-year study period, CT images were acquired of patients and controls in 11 thumb poses: neutral, adduction, abduction, flexion, extension, grasp, jar, pinch, grasp loaded, jar loaded, and pinch loaded. CT images were acquired at enrollment (Year 0) and Years 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 for patients and at Years 0 and 6 for controls. From the CT images, bone models of the first metacarpal (MC1) and trapezium were segmented, and coordinate systems were calculated from their CMC articular surfaces. The volar-dorsal location of the MC1 relative to the trapezium was computed and normalized for bone size. Patients were categorized into stable OA and progressing OA subgroups based on trapezial osteophyte volume. MC1 volar-dorsal location was analyzed by thumb pose, time, and disease severity using linear mixed-effects models. Data are reported as the mean and 95% confidence interval. Differences in volar-dorsal location at enrollment and rate of migration during the study were analyzed for each thumb pose by group (control, stable OA, and progressing OA). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of MC1 location was used to identify thumb poses that differentiated patients whose OA was stable from those whose OA was progressing. The Youden J statistic was used to determine optimized cutoff values of subluxation from those poses to be tested as indicators of OA progression. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive values, and positive predictive values were calculated to assess the performance of pose-specific cutoff values of MC1 locations as indicators of progressing OA. In flexion, the MC1 locations were volar to the joint center in patients with stable OA (mean -6.2% [95% CI -8.8% to -3.6%]) and controls (mean -6.1% [95% CI -8.9% to -3.2%]), while patients with progressing OA exhibited dorsal subluxation (mean 5.0% [95% CI 1.3% to 8.6%]; p < 0.001). The pose associated with the most rapid MC1 dorsal subluxation in the progressing OA group was thumb flexion (mean 3.2% [95% CI 2.5% to 3.9%] increase per year). In contrast, the MC1 migrated dorsally much slower in the stable OA group (p < 0.001), at only a mean of 0.1% (95% CI -0.4% to 0.6%) per year. A cutoff value of 1.5% for the volar MC1 position during flexion at enrollment (C-statistic: 0.70) was a moderate indicator of OA progression, with a high positive predictive value (0.80) but low negative predictive value (0.54). Positive and negative predictive values of subluxation rate in flexion (2.1% per year) were high (0.81 and 0.81, respectively). The metric that most indicated a high likelihood of OA progression (sensitivity 0.96, negative predictive value 0.89) was a dual cutoff that combined the subluxation rate in flexion (2.1% per year) with that of loaded pinch (1.2% per year). In the thumb flexion pose, only the progressing OA group exhibited MC1 dorsal subluxation. The MC1 location cutoff value for progression in flexion was 1.5% volar to the trapezium , which suggests that dorsal subluxation of any amount in this pose indicates a high likelihood of thumb CMC OA progression. However, volar MC1 location in flexion alone was not sufficient to rule out progression. The availability of longitudinal data improved our ability to identify patients whose disease will likely remain stable. In patients whose MC1 location during flexion changed < 2.1% per year and whose MC1 location during pinch loading changed < 1.2% per year, the confidence that their disease would remain stable throughout the 6-year study period was very high. These cutoff rates were a lower limit, and any patients whose dorsal subluxation advanced faster than 2% to 1% per year in their respective hand poses, were highly likely to experience progressive disease. Our findings suggest that in patients with early signs of CMC OA, nonoperative interventions aimed to reduce further dorsal subluxation or operative treatments that spare the trapezium and limit subluxation may be effective. It remains to be determined whether our subluxation metrics can be rigorously computed from more widely available technologies, such as plain radiography or ultrasound.

**Abstract:** Split liver transplant(ation) (SLT) is still considered a challenging procedure that is by no means widely accepted. We aimed to present data on 25-year trends in SLT in Italy, and to investigate if, and to what extent, outcomes have improved nationwide during this time. The study included all consecutive SLTs performed from May 1993 to December 2019, divided into three consecutive periods: 1993-2005, 2006-2014, and 2015-2019, which match changes in national allocation policies. Primary outcomes were patient and graft survival, and the relative impact of each study period. SLT accounted for 8.9% of all liver transplants performed in Italy. A total of 1,715 in situ split liver grafts were included inÂ the analysis: 868 left lateral segments (LLSs) and 847 extended right grafts (ERGs). A significant improvement in patient and graft survival (p <0.001) was observed with ERGs over the three periods. Predictors of graft survival were cold ischaemia time (CIT) <6Â h (pÂ = 0.009), UNOS status 2b (p <0.001), UNOS status 3 (pÂ = 0.009), and transplant centre volumes: 25-50 cases vs. <25 cases (pÂ = 0.003). Patient survival was significantly higher with LLS grafts in period 2 vs. period 1 (pÂ = 0.008). No significant improvement in graft survival was seen over the three periods, where predictors of graft survival were CIT <6Â h (pÂ = 0.007), CIT <6Â h vs. â‰¥10Â h (pÂ = 0.019), UNOS status 2b (pÂ = 0.038), and UNOS status 3 (pÂ = 0.009). Retransplantation was a risk factor in split liver graft recipients, with significantly worse graft and patient survival for both types of graft (p <0.001). Our analysis showed Italian SLT outcomes to have improved over the last 25 years. These results could help to dispel reservations regarding the use of this procedure. Split liver transplant(ation) (SLT) is still considered a challenging procedure and is by no means widely accepted. This study included all consecutive in situ SLTs performed in Italy from May 1993 to December 2019. With more than 1,700 cases, it is one of the largest series, examining long-term national trends in in situ SLT since its introduction. The data presented indicate that the outcomes of SLT improved during this 25-year period. Improvements are probably due to better recipient selection, refinements in surgical technique, conservative graft-to-recipient matching, and the continuous, yet carefully managed, expansion of donor selection criteria under a strict mandatory split liver allocation policy. These results could help to dispel reservations regarding the use of this procedure.

### 20. Empagliflozin Use in Cardiac Transplant Patients:
**Authors:** Muhammad I Butt, Roaa M H Albalwi, Norah Alnassar, Reem Alghamdi

**Abstract:** Sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are used in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. Besides their beneficial metabolic effects, such as lowering glycated haemoglobin, body weight and blood pressure, these agents have shown favourable and protective effects on both the heart and kidneys. Notably, these cardio-renal benefits are even seen in individuals without diabetes. However, there is limited evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in cardiac transplant recipients. This study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of empagliflozin in cardiac transplant recipients with diabetes. This retrospective study was conducted at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from June 2003 to May 2024. Patients from the cardiac transplant recipient register who were taking empagliflozin or a combination of empagliflozin and metformin were included. Consequently, their safety and efficacy parameters were examined. A total of 20 patients were included in this study. There was an improvement in haemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) levels, body weight and stability in serum creatinine. Additionally, there was no increased risk of genitourinary infections, hypoglycaemia or diabetic ketoacidosis. Although larger studies are needed to examine the use of empagliflozin in cardiac transplant patients, this small study provides assurance that empagliflozin is safe for use in cardiac transplant recipients.

### 21. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies for induction therapy in kidney transplant recipients.
**Authors:** Penny Hill, Nicholas B Cross, A Nicholas R Barnett, Suetonia C Palmer, Angela C Webster

**Abstract:** Prolonging kidney transplant survival is an important clinical priority. Induction immunosuppression with antibody therapy is recommended at transplantation and non-depleting interleukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibodies (IL2Ra) are considered first line. It is suggested that recipients at high risk of rejection should receive lymphocyte-depleting antibodies but the relative benefits and harms of the available agents are uncertain. We aimed to: evaluate the relative and absolute effects of different antibody preparations (except IL2Ra) when used as induction therapy in kidney transplant recipients; determine how the benefits and adverse events vary for each antibody preparation; determine how the benefits and harms vary for different formulations of antibody preparation; and determine whether the benefits and harms vary in specific subgroups of recipients (e.g. children and sensitised recipients). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies with placebo, no treatment, or other antibody therapy in adults and children who had received a kidney transplant. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies with placebo, no treatment, or other antibody therapy in adults and children who had received a kidney transplant. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Dichotomous outcomes are reported as relative risk (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD) together with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). We included 99 studies (269 records; 8956 participants; 33 with contemporary agents). Methodology was incompletely reported in most studies leading to lower confidence in the treatment estimates.Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) prevented acute graft rejection (17 studies: RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.78). The benefits of ATG on graft rejection were similar when used with (12 studies: RR 0.61, 0.49 to 0.76) or without (5 studies: RR 0.65, 0.43 to 0.98) calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) treatment. ATG (with CNI therapy) had uncertain effects on death (3 to 6 months, 3 studies: RR 0.41, 0.13 to 1.22; 1 to 2 years, 5 studies: RR 0.75, 0.27 to 2.06; 5 years, 2 studies: RR 0.94, 0.11 to 7.81) and graft loss (3 to 6 months, 4 studies: RR 0.60, 0.34 to 1.05; 1 to 2 years, 3 studies: RR 0.65, 0.36 to 1.19). The effect of ATG on death-censored graft loss was uncertain at 1 to 2 years and 5 years. In non-CNI studies, ATG had uncertain effects on death but reduced death-censored graft loss (6 studies: RR 0.55, 0.38 to 0.78). When CNI and older non-CNI studies were combined, a benefit was seen with ATG at 1 to 2 years for both all-cause graft loss (7 studies: RR 0.71, 0.53 to 0.95) and death-censored graft loss (8 studies: RR 0.55, 0.39 to 0.77) but not sustained longer term. ATG increased cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (6 studies: RR 1.55, 1.24 to 1.95), leucopenia (4 studies: RR 3.86, 2.79 to 5.34) and thrombocytopenia (4 studies: RR 2.41, 1.61 to 3.61) but had uncertain effects on delayed graft function, malignancy, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), and new onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT).Alemtuzumab was compared to ATG in six studies (446 patients) with early steroid withdrawal (ESW) or steroid minimisation. Alemtuzumab plus steroid minimisation reduced acute rejection compared to ATG at one year (4 studies: RR 0.57, 0.35 to 0.93). In the two studies with ESW only in the alemtuzumab arm, the effect of alemtuzumab on acute rejection at 1 year was uncertain compared to ATG (RR 1.27, 0.50 to 3.19). Alemtuzumab had uncertain effects on death (1 year, 2 studies: RR 0.39, 0.06 to 2.42; 2 to 3 years, 3 studies: RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.95), graft loss (1 year, 2 studies: RR 0.39, 0.13 to 1.30; 2 to 3 years, 3 studies: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.06), and death-censored graft loss (1 year, 2 studies: RR 0.38, 0.08 to 1.81; 2 to 3 years, 3 studies: RR 2.45, 95% CI 0.67 to 8.97) compared to ATG. Creatinine clearance was lower with alemtuzumab plus ESW at 6 months (2 studies: MD -13.35 mL/min, -23.91 to -2.80) and 2 years (2 studies: MD -12.86 mL/min, -23.73 to -2.00) compared to ATG plus triple maintenance. Across all 6 studies, the effect of alemtuzumab versus ATG was uncertain on all-cause infection, CMV infection, BK virus infection, malignancy, and PTLD. The effect of alemtuzumab with steroid minimisation on NODAT was uncertain, compared to ATG with steroid maintenance.Alemtuzumab plus ESW compared with triple maintenance without induction therapy had uncertain effects on death and all-cause graft loss at 1 year, acute rejection at 6 months and 1 year. CMV infection was increased (2 studies: RR 2.28, 1.18 to 4.40). Treatment effects were uncertain for NODAT, thrombocytopenia, and malignancy or PTLD.Rituximab had uncertain effects on death, graft loss, acute rejection and all other adverse outcomes compared to placebo. ATG reduces acute rejection but has uncertain effects on death, graft survival, malignancy and NODAT, and increases CMV infection, thrombocytopenia and leucopenia. Given a 45% acute rejection risk without ATG induction, seven patients would need treatment to prevent one having rejection, while incurring an additional patient experiencing CMV disease for every 12 treated. Excluding non-CNI studies, the risk of rejection was 37% without induction with six patients needing treatment to prevent one having rejection.In the context of steroid minimisation, alemtuzumab prevents acute rejection at 1 year compared to ATG. Eleven patients would require treatment with alemtuzumab to prevent 1 having rejection, assuming a 21% rejection risk with ATG.Triple maintenance without induction therapy compared to alemtuzumab combined with ESW had similar rates of acute rejection but adverse effects including NODAT were poorly documented. Alemtuzumab plus steroid withdrawal would cause one additional patient experiencing CMV disease for every six patients treated compared to no induction and triple maintenance, in the absence of any clinical benefit. Overall, ATG and alemtuzumab decrease acute rejection at a cost of increased CMV disease while patient-centred outcomes (reduced death or lower toxicity) do not appear to be improved.

### 22. Which Donor and Recipient Risk Factors Matter in Heart Transplantation? Results From a Survey of 53 Centers Across Five Countries.
**Authors:** Sabina P W Guenther, RenÃ© Schramm, Jeffrey J Teuteberg, Yasuhiro Shudo, Anna L Rogge, Katharina E Schaeper, Henrik Fox, Lisa Hoepner, Chawannuch Ruaengsri, Angelika Costard-Jaeckle, William Hiesinger, Y Joseph Woo, Michiel Morshuis, Kiran K Khush, Jan F Gummert, Brian J Wayda

**Abstract:** Consensus regarding what defines acceptable heart transplant (HT) donors or recipients is lacking. This survey analyzed how risk factors guide donor and recipient selection, and how practices vary across systems. An online survey was conducted among adult HT centers in the US and Eurotransplant (ET) region. We aimed to represent at least 50% of the total adult HT volumes in both regions. Centers were stratified by their HT volumes. To compensate for non-responders, a safety margin was included, and centers accounting for at least 75% of the total HT volumes were contacted. Centers were queried on relative thresholds and absolute cutoffs for continuous risk factors. For other factors, their influence on donor heart acceptance or the likelihood of listing recipients was assessed. Fifty-three centers from five countries participated: 39 US (accounting for 51.0% of the US HT volume), and 14 ET centers (65.0%) from four countries. ET centers more liberally considered advanced age donor hearts (threshold 64.5 [60.0-70.0] vs. 50.0 [50.0-55.0] years, pÂ <Â 0.001), and hearts with abnormal echocardiography or coronary findings. Diabetes, smoking, and hypertension were rated by a quarter to more than half of US and ET centers as moderately or heavily influencing donor heart acceptance. ET centers more liberally listed candidates with chronic kidney disease (GFR 30.0 [21.5-32.5] vs. 35.0 [30.0-40.0] mL/min/1.73m Selection practices differed distinctly between the US and ET. Further, practices appear to be driven by caution and are more conservative than current guidelines. Strengthening the evidence base to objectify and optimize donor and candidate selection could help alleviate the unmet need for donor hearts.

### 23. Comparison of Short-Term Outcomes in Kidney Transplant Recipients from SARS-CoV-2-Infected versus Noninfected Deceased Donors.
**Authors:** Junji Yamauchi, Ambreen Azhar, Isaac E Hall, Anshul Bhalla, Vishnu S Potluri, Bekir Tanriover, Gaurav Gupta, Hannah Imlay, Crystal Truax, Vasanthi Balaraman, Divya Raghavan, Michael Zimmerman, Jeffrey Campsen, George Rofaiel, Talia Baker, Miklos Z Molnar

**Abstract:** Acceptable post-transplant outcomes were reported in kidney transplant recipients from donors with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, there are no comparative studies with well-matched controls. This multicenter, prospective observational study, which included three transplant centers in the United States, enrolled 61 kidney recipients from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected deceased donors. Using optimal matching methods, we matched every recipient to three comparators receiving kidneys from SARS-CoV-2-negative deceased donors with otherwise highly similar characteristics in the same transplant centers to compare 6-month eGFR. Among recipients of SARS-CoV-2-infected donor kidneys, one recipient died with a functional graft within 6 months. Mean 6-month eGFR was not significantly different between SARS-CoV-2-infected and noninfected donor groups (55Â±21 and 57Â±25 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 , respectively; P = 0.61). Six-month eGFR in recipients from SARS-CoV-2-infected donors who died of reasons other than COVID-19 was not significantly different from those from SARS-CoV-2-negative donors (58Â±22 and 56Â±25 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 , respectively; P = 0.51). However, recipients from donors who died of COVID-19 had significantly lower 6-month eGFR than those from SARS-CoV-2-negative donors (46Â±17 and 58Â±27 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 , respectively; P = 0.03). No donor-to-recipient SARS-CoV-2 transmission was observed. Six-month eGFR was not significantly different between recipients of kidneys from SARS-CoV-2-infected and noninfected donors. However, those receiving kidneys from donors who died of COVID-19 had significantly lower 6-month eGFR. Donor-to-recipient SARS-CoV-2 transmission was not observed.

### 24. Can a Liquid Biopsy Detect Circulating Tumor DNA With Low-passage Whole-genome Sequencing in Patients With a Sarcoma? A Pilot Evaluation.
**Authors:** Colin J Anderson, HsihTe Yang, Judy Parsons, Will A Ahrens, Megan H Jagosky, Johann H Hsu, Joshua C Patt, Jeffrey S Kneisl, Nury M Steuerwald

**Abstract:** A liquid biopsy is a test that evaluates the status of a disease by analyzing a sample of bodily fluid, most commonly blood. In recent years, there has been progress in the development and clinical application of liquid biopsy methods to identify blood-based, tumor-specific biomarkers for many cancer types. However, the implementation of these technologies to aid in the treatment of patients who have a sarcoma remains behind other fields of cancer medicine. For this study, we chose to evaluate a sarcoma liquid biopsy based on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). All human beings have normal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) circulating in the blood. In contrast with cfDNA, ctDNA is genetic material present in the blood stream that is derived from a tumor. ctDNA carries the unique genomic fingerprint of the tumor with changes that are not present in normal circulating cfDNA. A successful ctDNA liquid biopsy must be able to target these tumor-specific genetic alterations. For instance, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are common in lung cancers, and ctDNA liquid biopsies are currently in clinical use to evaluate the status of disease in patients who have a lung cancer by detecting EGFR mutations in the blood. As opposed to many carcinomas, sarcomas do not have common recurrent mutations that could serve as the foundation to a ctDNA liquid biopsy. However, many sarcomas have structural changes to their chromosomes, including gains and losses of portions or entire chromosomes, known as copy number alterations (CNAs), that could serve as a target for a ctDNA liquid biopsy. Murine double minute 2 (MDM2) amplification in select lipomatous tumors or parosteal osteosarcoma is an example of a CNA due to the presence of extra copies of a segment of the long arm of chromosome 12. Since a majority of sarcomas demonstrate a complex karyotype with numerous CNAs, a blood-based liquid biopsy strategy that searches for these CNAs may be able to detect the presence of sarcoma ctDNA. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is a next-generation sequencing technique that evaluates the entire genome. The depth of coverage of WGS refers to how detailed the sequencing is, like higher versus lower power on a microscope. WGS can be performed with high-depth sequencing (that is, > 60Ã—), which can detect individual point mutations, or low-depth sequencing (that is, 0.1Ã— to 5Ã—), referred to as low-passage whole-genome sequencing (LP-WGS), which may not detect individual mutations but can detect structural chromosomal changes including gains and losses (that is, CNAs). While similar strategies have shown favorable early results for specific sarcoma subtypes, LP-WGS has not been evaluated for applicability to the broader population of patients who have a sarcoma. Does an LP-WGS liquid biopsy evaluating for CNAs detect ctDNA in plasma samples from patients who have sarcomas representing a variety of histologic subtypes? This was a retrospective study conducted at a community-based, tertiary referral center. Nine paired (plasma and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded [FFPE] tissue) and four unpaired (plasma) specimens from patients who had a sarcoma were obtained from a commercial biospecimen bank. Three control specimens from individuals who did not have cancer were also obtained. The paired and unpaired specimens from patients who had a sarcoma represented a variety of sarcoma histologic subtypes. cfDNA was extracted, amplified, and quantified. Libraries were prepared, and LP-WGS was performed using a NextSeq 500 next-generation sequencing machine at a low depth of sequencing coverage (âˆ¼1Ã—). The ichorCNA bioinformatics algorithm, which was designed to detect CNAs from low-depth genomic sequencing data, was used to analyze the data. In contrast with the gold standard for diagnosis in the form of histopathologic analysis of a tissue sample, this test does not discriminate between sarcoma subtypes but detects the presence of tumor-derived CNAs within the ctDNA in the blood that should not be present in a patient who does not have cancer. The liquid biopsy was positive for the detection of cancer if the ichorCNA algorithm detected the presence of ctDNA. The algorithm was also used to quantitatively estimate the percent ctDNA within the cfDNA. The concentration of ctDNA was then calculated from the percent ctDNA relative to the total concentration of cfDNA. The CNAs of the paired FFPE tissue and plasma samples were graphically visualized using aCNViewer software. This LP-WGS liquid biopsy detected ctDNA in 9 of 13 of the plasma specimens from patients with a sarcoma. The other four samples from patients with a sarcoma and all serum specimens from patients without cancer had no detectable ctDNA. Of those 9 patients with positive liquid biopsy results, the percent ctDNA ranged from 6% to 11%, and calculated ctDNA quantities were 0.04 to 5.6 ng/mL, which are levels to be expected when ctDNA is detectable. In this small pilot study, we were able to detect sarcoma ctDNA with an LP-WGS liquid biopsy searching for CNAs in the plasma of most patients who had a sarcoma representing a variety of histologic subtypes. These results suggest that an LP-WGS liquid biopsy evaluating for CNAs to identify ctDNA may be more broadly applicable to the population of patients who have a sarcoma than previously reported in studies focusing on specific subtypes. Large prospective clinical trials that gather samples at multiple time points during the process of diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance will be needed to further assess whether this technique can be clinically useful. At our institution, we are in the process of developing a large prospective clinical trial for this purpose.

### 25. Severe Relapsing Hailey-Hailey Disease Displaying a Durable Complete Response to Hydroxyurea.
**Authors:** Constantin A Dasanu

**Abstract:** Familial benign chronic pemphigus, also known as Hailey-Hailey disease, was first described by the Hailey brothers in 1939 (1). It represents a chronic autosomal-dominant genetic skin disorder with incomplete penetrance, usually diagnosed in children and young adults. As a result, family history of this disorder can be elicited in only about 66% of patients. We describe herein a patient with Hailey-Hailey disease who received treatment with hydroxyurea for a new diagnosis of polycythemia vera, with a surprising outcome. A 54-year-old man was diagnosed with Hailey-Hailey disease at age ten when he presented with several erythematous and blistering skin lesions involving the neck, wrist flexure surfaces, and the forearms. The patient underwent regular dermatology follow-up for this condition. His disease followed a relapsing-remitting pattern, with short disease-free intervals. It predominantly involved the neck, torso, and upper extremities (Figure 1), and only rarely buttocks and groin areas. Initially, mild-moderate potency topical steroid creams were tried, with only modest success. Topical antibiotics were required on several occasions due to secondary infections. Photodynamic therapy was only minimally helpful, as the disease continued to worsen. In his 40s, the disease became more difficult to manage, and several systemic options were tried, with very little if any success. Thus, the patient failed oral steroids, dapsone and azathioprine. He became anxious, depressed, and socially isolated. Other past medical history was significant for hypertension. The patient was a never-smoker, and denied alcohol or drug abuse. There was no family history of skin disorders of cancers in his immediate family members. In May 2019, the patient presented with elevated hemoglobin/hematocrit and moderate thrombocytosis. Further work-up identified JAK-2 V617F kinase mutated polycythemia vera, for which he was started on periodic phlebotomies and low-dose aspirin. Four months later, hydroxyurea was prescribed due to increased phlebotomy needs and worsening thrombocytosis. The hydroxyurea dose was subsequently titrated to 1000 mg orally per day, alternating with 1500 mg orally per day. The patient tolerated this agent well, without significant side-effects. He also achieved excellent control of hematocrit and normalization of platelet count. Pleasantly surprised, the patient also realized that he had not experienced any more relapsing Hailey-Hailey skin lesions 8 weeks after the commencement of hydroxyurea. Four years later, his polycythemia remains in excellent control. He also remains without any further evidence of skin lesions. The hallmark of Hailey-Hailey disease is believed to be the haploinsufficiency of the enzyme ATP2C1 (2). The ATP2C1 gene is located on chromosome 3 and encodes a Ca2+ ATPase protein. A mutation in one copy of the gene causes only half of this necessary protein to be synthesized. Consequently, impaired keratinocyte adhesion ensues, leading to acantholysis, blisters, and rash (2). The initial lesion may be an erythematous area or a fluid-filled blister which subsequently ruptures, leading to a macerated or crusted lesion. The lesions more commonly affect the sides of the neck, armpits, forearms, buttocks and groins, but may expand to a generalized skin eruption. Patients may complain of itching in the affected areas, potentially leading to social distress and isolation (3). Affected areas undergo repeated blistering and inflammation, and may be tender to touch. A pattern of multiple relapses and remissions is characteristic of Hailey-Hailey disease. Nonetheless, most lesions are transient and leave little or no scars (Figure 2). The differential diagnosis includes intertrigo, contact dermatitis, pemphigus, psoriasis, and cutaneous candidiasis. Skin biopsy and/or family history can confirm the diagnosis of Hailey-Hayley disease. The lack of both mucosal lesions and intercellular antibodies on immunohistochemistry distinguishes this entity from other forms of pemphigus. Hailey-Hayley disease is currently believed to be incurable, and its complications include secondary bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, which may require antimicrobial agents (4). The patients are advised to avoid friction and sweating by wearing light cotton clothes. Sun avoidance as much as possible and using SPF 50 sunscreen while in the sun are advised. Applying soothing compresses followed by topical corticosteroid cream can offer symptom relief (3,4). Topical antibiotics can be used for localized lesions. Generalized lesions may require systemic steroids and antibiotics. Topical tacrolimus, laser, and photodynamic therapy have been used with varying degrees of success in the second line (4). Oral dapsone, cyclosporine, azathioprine, thalidomide, etretinate, and intramuscular alefacept were shown to control the mild-moderate disease but not severe chronic or relapsing forms (4). Surgical skin grafting usually represents the last resort in resistant localized disease. Mestre et al. (5) described a case of chronic Hailey-Hailey disease in a Caucasian woman, whose skin lesions were refractory to topical and oral steroids, tetracyclines, antifungals, and azathioprine. After introduction of weekly oral methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis treatment, the skin lesions regressed, with significant impact on the patient's quality of life. Similarly, Hailey-Hailey disease in our patient responded completely to hydroxyurea, without any relapses over a 4-year interval. Hydroxyurea has been used for many decades in hematology and oncology, has a favorable side-effect profile, and is cost-effective. Our case report supports the clinical evidence of hydroxyurea's potential role in Hailey-Hailey disease treatment. There is hope that our findings will be confirmed by larger studies and shift the treatment paradigm in severe chronic or relapsing-remitting forms of Hailey-Hailey disease.

**Abstract:** This is an update of the Cochrane review published in Issue 5, 2011. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the fourth commonest cancer affecting women. High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is causative in 99.7% of cases. Other risk factors include smoking, multiple sexual partners, the presence of other sexually transmitted diseases and immunosuppression. Primary prevention strategies for cervical cancer focus on reducing HPV infection via vaccination and data suggest that this has the potential to prevent nearly 90% of cases in those vaccinated prior to HPV exposure. However, not all countries can afford vaccination programmes and, worryingly, uptake in many countries has been extremely poor. Secondary prevention, through screening programmes, will remain critical to reducing cervical cancer, especially in unvaccinated women or those vaccinated later in adolescence. This includes screening for the detection of pre-cancerous cells, as well as high-risk HPV. In the UK, since the introduction of the Cervical Screening Programme in 1988, the associated mortality rate from cervical cancer has fallen. However, worldwide, there is great variation between countries in both coverage and uptake ofÂ screening. In some countries,Â national screening programmes are availableÂ whereas in others, screening is provided on an opportunistic basis. Additionally, there are differences within countries in uptake dependent on ethnic origin, age, education and socioeconomic status. Thus, understanding and incorporating these factors in screening programmes can increase the uptake of screening. This, together with vaccination, can lead to cervical cancer becoming a rare disease. To assess the effectiveness of interventions aimed at women, to increase the uptake, including informed uptake, of cervical screening. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Issue 6, 2020. MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS databases up to June 2020. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions to increase uptake/informed uptake of cervical screening. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Where possible, the data were synthesised in a meta-analysis using standard Cochrane methodology. Comprehensive literature searchesÂ identified 2597 records; of these, 70 met our inclusion criteria, of which 69Â trials (257,899 participants) were entered into a meta-analysis. The studies assessed the effectiveness of invitational and educational interventions, lay health worker involvement, counselling and risk factor assessment. Clinical and statistical heterogeneity between trials limited statistical pooling of data. Overall, there was moderate-certainty evidence to suggest that invitations appear to be an effective method of increasing uptake compared to control (risk ratio (RR) 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 1.96; 141,391 participants; 24 studies). Additional analyses, ranging from low to moderate-certainty evidence, suggested that invitations that were personalised, i.e.Â personal invitation, GP invitation letter or letter with a fixed appointment, appeared to be more successful.Â More specifically, there was very low-certainty evidence to support the use of GP invitation letters as compared to other authority sources' invitation letters within two RCTs, one RCT assessingÂ 86 participants (RR 1.69 95% CI 0.75 to 3.82) and another,Â showing a modest benefit,Â included over 4000 participants (RR 1.13, 95 % CI 1.05 to 1.21). Low-certainty evidence favoured personalised invitations (telephone call, face-to-face or targeted letters) as compared to standard invitation letters (RR 1.32, 95 % CI 1.11 to 1.21; 27,663 participants; 5 studies). There was moderate-certainty evidence to support a letter with a fixed appointment to attend, as compared to a letter with an open invitation to make an appointment (RR 1.61, 95 % CI 1.48 to 1.75; 5742 participants; 5 studies). Low-certainty evidenceÂ supported the use of educational materials (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.54; 63,415 participants; 13 studies) and lay health worker involvement (RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.44 to 3.65; 4330 participants; 11 studies). Other less widely reported interventions included counselling, risk factor assessment, access to a health promotion nurse, photo comic book, intensive recruitment and message framing. It was difficult to deduce any meaningful conclusions from these interventions due to sparse data and low-certainty evidence. However, having access to a health promotion nurse and attempts at intensive recruitment may have increasedÂ uptake. One trial reported an economic outcome and randomised 3124 participants within a national screening programme to either receive the standard screening invitation, which would incur a fee, or an invitation offering screening free of charge. No difference in the uptakeÂ at 90 days was found (574/1562 intervention versus 612/1562 control, (RR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.03). The use of HPV self-testing as an alternative to conventional screening may also be effective at increasing uptake andÂ this will be coveredÂ in a subsequent review. Secondary outcomes, including cost data, were incompletely documented. The majority of cluster-RCTs did not account for clustering or adequately report the number of clusters in the trial in order to estimate the design effect, so we did not selectively adjust the trials. It is unlikely that reporting of theseÂ trials would impact the overall conclusions and robustness of the results. Of the meta-analyses that could be performed, there wasÂ considerable statistical heterogeneity, and this should be borne in mind when interpreting these findings. Given this and the low to moderate evidence, further research may change these findings. The risk of bias in the majority of trials was unclear, and a number of trials suffered from methodological problems and inadequate reporting. We downgraded the certainty of evidence because of an unclear or high risk of bias with regards to allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data and other biases. There is moderate-certainty evidence to support the use of invitation letters to increase the uptake of cervical screening. Low-certainty evidence showedÂ lay health worker involvement amongst ethnic minority populations may increase screening coverage,Â and there was also support for educational interventions, but it is unclear what format is most effective. The majority of the studies were from developed countries and so the relevance of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), is unclear. Overall, the low-certainty evidence that was identifiedÂ makes it difficult to infer as to which interventions were best, with exception of invitational interventions, where there appeared to be more reliable evidence.

### 28. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for coronary heart disease.
**Authors:** Lindsey Anderson, David R Thompson, Neil Oldridge, Ann-Dorthe Zwisler, Karen Rees, Nicole Martin, Rod S Taylor

**Abstract:** Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the single most common cause of death globally. However, with falling CHD mortality rates, an increasing number of people live with CHD and may need support to manage their symptoms and prognosis. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) aims to improve the health and outcomes of people with CHD. This is an update of a Cochrane systematic review previously published in 2011. To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of exercise-based CR (exercise training alone or in combination with psychosocial or educational interventions) compared with usual care on mortality, morbidity and HRQL in patients with CHD.To explore the potential study level predictors of the effectiveness of exercise-based CR in patients with CHD. We updated searches from the previous Cochrane review, by searching Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 6, 2014) from December 2009 to July 2014. We also searched MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO) and Science Citation Index Expanded (December 2009 to July 2014). We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise-based interventions with at least six months' follow-up, compared with a no exercise control. The study population comprised men and women of all ages who have had a myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or who have angina pectoris, or coronary artery disease. We included RCTs that reported at least one of the following outcomes: mortality, MI, revascularisations, hospitalisations, health-related quality of life (HRQL), or costs. Two review authors independently screened all identified references for inclusion based on the above inclusion and exclusion criteria. One author extracted data from the included trials and assessed their risk of bias; a second review author checked data. We stratified meta-analysis by the duration of follow up of trials, i.e. short-term: 6 to 12 months, medium-term: 13 to 36 months, and long-term: > 3 years. This review included 63 trials which randomised 14,486 people with CHD. This latest update identified 16 new trials (3872 participants). The population included predominantly post-MI and post-revascularisation patients and the mean age of patients within the trials ranged from 47.5 to 71.0 years. Women accounted for fewer than 15% of the patients recruited. Overall trial reporting was poor, although there was evidence of an improvement in quality of reporting in more recent trials.As we found no significant difference in the impact of exercise-based CR on clinical outcomes across follow-up, we focused on reporting findings pooled across all trials at their longest follow-up (median 12 months). Exercise-based CR reduced cardiovascular mortality compared with no exercise control (27 trials; risk ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.86). There was no reduction in total mortality with CR (47 trials, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.04). The overall risk of hospital admissions was reduced with CR (15 trials; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.96) but there was no significant impact on the risk of MI (36 trials; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.04), CABG (29 trials; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.16) or PCI (18 trials; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.04).There was little evidence of statistical heterogeneity across trials for all event outcomes, and there was evidence of small study bias for MI and hospitalisation, but no other outcome. Predictors of clinical outcomes were examined across the longest follow-up of studies using univariate meta-regression. Results show that benefits in outcomes were independent of participants' CHD case mix (proportion of patients with MI), type of CR (exercise only vs comprehensive rehabilitation) dose of exercise, length of follow-up, trial publication date, setting (centre vs home-based), study location (continent), sample size or risk of bias.Given the heterogeneity in outcome measures and reporting methods, meta-analysis was not undertaken for HRQL. In five out of 20 trials reporting HRQL using validated measures, there was evidence of significant improvement in most or all of the sub-scales with exercise-based CR compared to control at follow-up. Four trial-based economic evaluation studies indicated exercise-based CR to be a potentially cost-effective use of resources in terms of gain in quality-adjusted life years.The quality of the evidence for outcomes reported in the review was rated using the GRADE method. The quality of the evidence varied widely by outcome and ranged from low to moderate. This updated Cochrane review supports the conclusions of the previous version of this review that, compared with no exercise control, exercise-based CR reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality but not total mortality. We saw a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalisation with CR but not in the risk of MI or revascularisation. We identified further evidence supporting improved HRQL with exercise-based CR. More recent trials were more likely to be well reported and include older and female patients. However, the population studied in this review still consists predominantly of lower risk individuals following MI or revascularisation. Further well conducted RCTs are needed to assess the impact of exercise-based CR in higher risk CHD groups and also those presenting with stable angina. These trials should include validated HRQL outcome measures, explicitly report clinical event outcomes including mortality and hospital admissions, and assess costs and cost-effectiveness.

### 29. The experiences of adults who are on dialysis and waiting for a renal transplant from a deceased donor: a systematic review.
**Authors:** Tania Burns, Ritin Fernandez, Moira Stephens

**Abstract:** Kidney transplantation has been recognized as the best renal replacement therapy option for people with end stage renal disease. With an estimated 170,000 people waiting for a kidney transplant around the world and a limited supply of donor organs, the waiting time is often prolonged for many years. The aim of this review was to examine the existing evidence of patients' experiences of living on dialysis and waiting for a renal transplant from a deceased donor. This review considered studies that included adult patients aged 18 years and over who had been on dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) for up to 15 years and who were waiting for a renal transplant from a deceased donor. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest: The phenomena of interest were the experiences of adults waiting for a renal transplant from a deceased donor and more specifically, the impact of waiting on their lifestyle and day to day living. Types of studies: This review considered studies that focused on qualitative data including, but not limited to, designs such as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research and feminist research. Types of outcomes: This review considered studies that included the experiences of people who were waiting on dialysis for a kidney transplant from a deceased donor. The search strategy aimed to find both published and unpublished studies through electronic databases, reference list searches and the World Wide Web. Extensive searches were undertaken of the CINAHL, Embase, Medline and PsychInfo databases of published literature, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Virginia Henderson International Nursing Library, OpenGrey and the New York Academy of Medicine databases of unpublished literature. Each study was assessed for methodological quality by two independent reviewers using the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument checklist. Disagreements between the reviewers were resolved through discussion or with a third reviewer. Qualitative data was extracted from papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI-Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument. Qualitative research findings were pooled to generate a set of statements that represented the aggregation and categorizing of these findings on the basis of similarity in meaning. These categories were then subjected to a meta-synthesis in order to produce a comprehensive set of synthesized findings that can be used as a basis for evidence-based practice. A total of 12 studies were included in the final review. Thirty-seven findings from the 12 studies were extracted and aggregated into 11 categories and then into three synthesized findings. The three synthesized findings were: 1. People who are waiting for a kidney transplant from a deceased donor are affected by the experience of living on dialysis with end stage renal disease and its impact on their physical health and normal activities of living. 2. The experience of waiting for a kidney transplant from a deceased donor impacts a person's psychological wellbeing. 3. People who are waiting for a kidney transplant from a deceased donor place value on relationships and being part of a community. The experience of waiting for a renal transplant from a deceased donor while living on dialysis with end stage renal disease changes a person's relationships. Synthesized findings of the review conclude that people who are waiting for a kidney transplant from a deceased donor live with the physical effects of a life limiting chronic illness and dialysis therapy. Waiting for a kidney transplant is psychologically challenging. People waiting for a kidney transplant value knowledge, although the information they require to alleviate the uncertainty they feel is not available. The dynamics of relationships with family and friends are affected by the experience of waiting for a kidney transplant. People can feel isolated from others leading a 'normal' life, while new relationships are developed within the medical team and community of dialysis patients. There is limited evidence from the review to support the development of recommendations for clinical practice. Healthcare workers caring for people who are waiting for a kidney transplant from a deceased donor should be mindful of the physical and lifestyle effects of living on dialysis with end stage renal disease. Wherever possible, information should be provided to alleviate the stress and anxiety related to the uncertainty of waiting. The experience of waiting is stressful and people waiting for a kidney transplant may require support and reassurance. It is important to recognize that there are people within communities who may also benefit from receiving information and encouragement. Significant community members should be included in invitations to appointments and education sessions with the consent of the person being treated. Future studies should be undertaken exclusively with people waiting for a kidney transplant from a deceased donor. Qualitative research designs such phenomenology and grounded theory could be used to investigate the psychological experience of waiting and the relationship between hope, uncertainty and knowledge. Quantitative studies using validated tools could also be conducted. By producing more evidence relating to this significant specific patient population, interventions to improve the experience of waiting could be developed and trialed.

### 30. Identifying the association between tacrolimus exposure and toxicity in heart and lung transplant recipients: A systematic review.
**Authors:** H E Braithwaite, D R Darley, J Brett, R O Day, J E Carland

**Abstract:** Tacrolimus is the cornerstone of immunosuppression management in heart and lung transplant recipients, improving overall survival. However, tacrolimus-associated toxicities, including nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, new-onset diabetes mellitus after transplant (NODAT), and gastrointestinal toxicity, are known contributors to increased post-transplant morbidity outcomes and reduced graft and recipient survival rates. The aim of this systematic review was to identify correlations between pharmacokinetic measures of tacrolimus exposure in heart and lung recipients and tacrolimus toxicities. MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CENTRAL and WHO Clinical Trial Registries were searched for published studies evaluating tacrolimus toxicities and their correlation to pharmacokinetic monitoring parameters in thoracic transplant recipients. Studies were reviewed by two authors, with data extracted for evaluation. Risk of bias was assessed using the PEDro scale for randomised control trials and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale for non-randomised cohort studies. Eighteen studies were eligible; a randomised control trial, 11 observational cohort studies, and 6 case series or studies. Of these, 9 studies were in heart transplant recipients alone and 5 in lung transplant recipients alone, 2 studies were in heart and lung transplant recipients and 2 were heart, lung, liver or renal transplant recipients. Studies used variable criteria to define toxicities. Tacrolimus trough concentration (C No clearly defined relationship between tacrolimus exposure and toxicities is described in the literature. Studies with clear toxicity criteria and pharmacokinetic markers of tacrolimus exposure are required to provide valuable information that may optimise tacrolimus therapy, helping to reduce toxicities in heart and lung transplant recipients.

### 31. Reliability and validity of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) for detecting perinatal common mental disorders (PCMDs) among women in low-and lower-middle-income countries: a systematic review.
**Authors:** Sumitra Devi Shrestha, Rina Pradhan, Thach D Tran, Rosa C Gualano, Jane R W Fisher

**Abstract:** The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), originally developed in Britain, is one of the most widely used screening instruments for assessing symptoms of the Perinatal Common Mental Disorders (PCMDs) of depression and anxiety. However, its potential to detect PCMDs in culturally diverse low- and lower-middle income countries (LALMICs) is unclear. This systematic review aimed to appraise formally validated local language versions of the EPDS from these resource-constrained settings. Following the PRISMA protocol, we searched MEDLINE-OVID, CINAHL-Plus and PUBMED to identify studies reporting translation, cultural adaptation and formal validation of the EPDS to detect PCMDs among women in LALMICs. The quality of the studies meeting inclusion criteria was assessed using standard criteria and a new process-based criteria; which was developed specifically for this study. We identified 1281 records among which 16 met inclusion criteria; three further papers were identified by hand-searching reference lists. The publications reported findings from 12 LALMICs in 14 native languages. Most of these local language versions of the EPDS (LLV-EPDS) had lower precision for identifying true cases of PCMDs among women in the general perinatal population compared to the original English version. Only one study met all criteria for culturally sensitive translation, the others had not established the comprehensibility of the local version amongst representative groups of women in pre-testing. Many studies tested the LLV-EPDS only amongst convenience samples recruited at single health facilities. Diagnostic interviews for confirmation of mental disorders could have been influenced by the mental health professionals' lack of blinding to the initial screening results. Additionally, even when diagnostic-interviews were carried out in the local language, questions might not have been understood as most studies followed standard diagnostic protocol which had not been culturally adapted. Most of the LLV-EPDS from non-English speaking low- and middle-income-countries did not meet all criteria for formal validation of a screening instrument. Psychometric properties of LLV-EPDS could be enhanced by adopting the new process-based criteria for translation, adaptation and validation.

### 32. Optimisation of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for untreated Hodgkin lymphoma patients with respect to second malignant neoplasms, overall and progression-free survival: individual participant data analysis.
**Authors:** Jeremy Franklin, Dennis A Eichenauer, Ingrid Becker, Ina Monsef, Andreas Engert

**Abstract:** Efficacy and the risk of severe late effects have to be well-balanced in treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Late adverse effects include secondary malignancies which often have a poor prognosis. To synthesise evidence on the risk of secondary malignancies after current treatment approaches comprising chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, we performed a meta-analysis based on individual patient data (IPD) from patients treated for newly diagnosed HL. We investigated several questions concerning possible changes in the risk of secondary malignancies when modifying chemotherapy or radiotherapy (omission of radiotherapy, reduction of the radiation field, reduction of the radiation dose, use of fewer chemotherapy cycles, intensification of chemotherapy). We also analysed whether these modifications affect progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL trials databases comprehensively in June 2010 for all randomised trials in HL since 1984. Key international trials registries were also searched. The search was updated in March 2015 without collecting further IPD (one further eligible study found) and again in July 2017 (no further eligible studies). We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for untreated HL patients which enrolled at least 50 patients per arm, completed recruitment by 2007 and performed a treatment comparison relevant to our objectives. Study groups submitted IPD, including age, sex, stage and the outcomes secondary malignant neoplasm (SMN), OS and PFS as time-to-event data. We meta-analysed these data using Petos method (SMN) and Cox regression with inverse-variance pooling (OS, PFS) for each of the five study questions, and performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses to assess the applicability and robustness of the results. We identified 21 eligible trials and obtained IPD for 16. For four studies no data were supplied despite repeated efforts, while one study was only identified in 2015 and IPD were not sought. For each study question, between three and six trials with between 1101 and 2996 participants in total and median follow-up between 6.7 and 10.8 years were analysed. All participants were adults and mainly under 60 years. Risk of bias was assessed as low for the majority of studies and outcomes. Chemotherapy alone versus same chemotherapy plus radiotherapy. Omitting additional radiotherapy probably reduces secondary malignancy incidence (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.82, low quality of evidence), corresponding to an estimated reduction of eight-year SMN risk from 8% to 4%. This decrease was particularly true for secondary acute leukemias. However, we had insufficient evidence to determine whether OS rates differ between patients treated with chemotherapy alone versus combined-modality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.11, moderate quality of evidence). There was a slightly higher rate of PFS with combined modality, but our confidence in the results was limited by high levels of statistical heterogeneity between studies (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.73, moderate quality of evidence). Chemotherapy plus involved-field radiation versus same chemotherapy plus extended-field radiation (early stages) . There is insufficient evidence to determine whether smaller radiation field reduces SMN risk (Peto OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.16, low quality of evidence), OS (HR 0.89, 95% C: 0.70 to 1.12, high quality of evidence) or PFS (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.21, high quality of evidence). Chemotherapy plus lower-dose radiation versus same chemotherapy plus higher-dose radiation (early stages). There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of lower-radiation dose on SMN risk (Peto OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.50, low quality of evidence), OS (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.28, high quality of evidence) or PFS (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.48, high quality of evidence). Fewer versus more courses of chemotherapy (each with or without radiotherapy; early stages). Fewer chemotherapy courses probably has little or no effect on SMN risk (Peto OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.62), OS (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.73 to1.34) or PFS (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.45).Outcomes had a moderate (SMN) or high (OS, PFS) quality of evidence. Dose-intensified versus ABVD-like chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy in each case). In the mainly advanced-stage patients who were treated with intensified chemotherapy, the rate of secondary malignancies was low. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of chemotherapy intensification (Peto OR 1.37, CI 0.89 to 2.10, low quality of evidence). The rate of secondary acute leukemias (and for younger patients, all secondary malignancies) was probably higher than among those who had treatment with standard-dose ABVD-like protocols. In contrast, the intensified chemotherapy protocols probably improved PFS (eight-year PFS 75% versus 69% for ABVD-like treatment, HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.95, moderate quality of evidence). Evidence suggesting improved survival with intensified chemotherapy was not conclusive (HR: 0.85, CI 0.70 to 1.04), although escalated-dose BEACOPP appeared to lengthen survival compared to ABVD-like chemotherapy (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.79, moderate quality of evidence).Generally, we could draw valid conclusions only in terms of secondary haematological malignancies, which usually occur less than 10 years after initial treatment, while follow-up within the present analysis was too short to record all solid tumours. The risk of secondary acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) is increased but efficacy is improved among patients treated with intensified chemotherapy protocols. Treatment decisions must be tailored for individual patients. Consolidating radiotherapy is associated with an increased rate of secondary malignancies; therefore it appears important to define which patients can safely be treated without radiotherapy after chemotherapy, both for early and advanced stages. For early stages, treatment optimisation methods such as use of fewer chemotherapy cycles and reduced field or reduced-dose radiotherapy did not appear to markedly affect efficacy or secondary malignancy risk. Due to the limited amount of long-term follow-up in this meta-analysis, further long-term investigations of late events are needed, particularly with respect to secondary solid tumours. Since many older studies have been included, possible improvement of radiotherapy techniques must be considered when interpreting these results.

### 33. Morphological, functional and neurological outcomes of craniectomy versus cranial vault remodeling for isolated nonsyndromic synostosis of the sagittal suture: a systematic review.
**Authors:** May Thwin, Timothy J Schultz, Peter J Anderson

**Abstract:** Craniosynostosis is a condition characterized by the premature closure of one or more of the cranial vault sutures. It can occur alone or in association with other congenital defects and may be part of a syndrome. The sagittal suture is most commonly affected, comprising 40-60% of cases. Premature fusion of the sagittal suture can cause scaphocephaly due to compensatory anterior-posterior growth of the skull. This is morphologically considered as a narrow elongated skull with a decreased cephalic index, and is diagnosed clinically and/or radiologically. Both the indications for surgery and the techniques used have varied with time and location. Surgical techniques have evolved, from limited craniectomy to calvarial remodeling. In recent times a return to craniectomy methods has occurred with the more recent introduction of endoscopic methods. The objectives of this review were to identify and synthesize the best available evidence on the morphological, functional and neurological outcomes of craniectomy compared to cranial vault remodeling. This review considered studies of infants with primary isolated sagittal synostosis operated on or before the mean age of 24 months. The intervention of interest was local craniectomy and this was compared to cranial vault remodeling. Morphological (primary), functional and neurological (secondary) outcomes were included. Mortality, complications and aesthetic outcome were included as tertiary outcomes. A comprehensive search was undertaken across major databases. The retrieved studies were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion. Data was then extracted and, where possible, pooled in statistical meta-analysis. For descriptive studies, where statistical pooling was not possible, the findings are presented in narrative form. Search and retrieval: Based on critical appraisal, 27 studies were considered to be suitable for this review. These studies were all descriptive in nature. Meta-analysis was only possible for the primary morphological outcome (post-operative cephalic index).Morphological (cephalic index):At one year follow-up, post-operatively remodeling offers an advantage over craniectomy (Z = 4.16, P<0.0001)Morphological:Improvements of the cephalic index to varying degrees were seen in patients receiving either procedure and there is not enough evidence to suggest that either treatment group had greater improvement over the other.Functional and neurological:Although their global scores may be comparable to an age-matched population, patients with sagittal synostosis who have undergone a surgical repair of any type may have discrepancies in specific domains and may be at risk of developing learning disorders. There is insufficient primary research with inter-procedure comparisons of preoperative and postoperative cognitive and neurological outcomes.Tertiary outcomes:There is not enough evidence to comment on mortality or postoperative infection in either treatment group. Patients undergoing cranial vault remodeling have a higher rate of transfusion compared to those undergoing craniectomy; however, it is likely that this difference relates to elective transfusion based on hospital-specific protocols. It remains unknown whether there is an inherently higher need for transfusion in patients undergoing remodeling procedures. Delaying surgery however may increase the risk of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and its associated complications. Whilst there is no evidence for raised ICP post-craniectomy, a few studies have shown raised ICP in patients post-remodeling. There is not enough evidence to establish a relationship between both procedures and raised ICP. Aesthetic outcome appears to be "better" in patients who undergo remodeling; however, there is little rigorous evidence to support this hypothesis. Conclusions were drawn from both the meta-analysis and the narrative results.When comparing the mean change in cephalic index one year after surgery, remodeling was shown to be superior to limited craniectomy in patients with isolated synostosis of the sagittal suture. However both procedures were seen to give improvements at short, medium and longer term time points. Improvements in cephalic index may be sustained, deteriorate or improve over time; based on the current data neither procedure offers a clear long-term advantage over the other. Longer follow-up is required to compare outcomes at different time points.Patients who have surgery (any type) for isolated sagittal synostosis may have deficiencies in different subdomains at later school-age testing, whilst maintaining an age-appropriate global intelligence quotient (IQ) and school performance. There is no evidence to suggest that surgery of either type imparts any benefit in terms of functional or neurological outcomes.There is no evidence to suggest that surgery of either type imparts any benefit in terms of functional or neurological outcomes. While school performance and general IQ may be comparable to age-matched controls, patients with sagittal synostosis who have undergone surgical repair of any type may be at risk of deficiencies in sub-areas of testing and be at risk of learning disorders.There is insufficient evidence regarding mortality, infection, postoperative ICP and aesthetic outcome. While transfusion rates were greater in the remodeling group, this may be due to higher rates of elective transfusion.The inconclusive findings indicate an ongoing need for higher quality primary research comparing the morphological and functional outcomes of craniectomy and cranial vault remodeling in primary sagittal synostosis. Outcomes should be measured in both the short and long term.

**Authors:** Isaac S Alderete, Cathlyn K Medina, Arya Pontula, Samantha E Halpern, Alexandria L Soto, Kunal J Patel, Jacob A Klapper, Matthew G Hartwig

**Abstract:** Current risk-adjusted models for predicting primary graft dysfunction (PGD) following lung transplantation (LTx) do not include bedside donor critical care data. Donor management goals (DMGs) represent predefined critical care endpoints aimed at optimizing multiorgan donor management. Here we sought to identify novel predictors to better understand the relationship between donor management and PGD following LTx. We used the national DMG registry to identify a cohort of LTx recipients linked to their respective donors between January 1, 2015, and March 1, 2023. Grade 3 PGD (PGD3) was defined according to modified International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation criteria. Multivariable modeling was performed to identify risk factors for the development of PGD3. A total of 2704 eligible patients were identified, of whom 643 (23.8%) developed PGD3. After multivariable modeling, the likelihood of PGD3 was greater with increasing donor age (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.10 per 5-year change; P = .003), increasing donor serum pH at the time of authorization (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.02-1.25 per 0.1-point increase; P = .016), donor history of cocaine use (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.05-1.71; P = .020), and increased recipient central venous pressure (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06; P = .005). Recipients who received donor lungs in which the DMG for PF ratio was met had a lower likelihood of developing PGD3 (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-0.86; P = .006). This study leverages a novel detailed donor management database to identify factors associated with the development of PGD3. These factors may be used to recognize donors and recipients who may benefit from early interventions to improve short-term outcomes.

### 35. Case Report: Treatment of delayed tremor episodes in a patient with DPPX antibody encephalitis.
**Authors:** Miao Yu, XinSheng Liu, JunQiang Yan

**Abstract:** Autoimmune encephalitis is a neurological disease caused by abnormal autoimmune mechanisms, characterized by a range of symptoms such as psychiatric and behavioral abnormalities, cognitive impairment, memory decline, and seizures. It is primarily identified by the presence of autoantibodies against neuronal surface antigens in the cerebrospinal fluid. This disease is relatively rare in clinical settings, and its diagnosis remains challenging, with fewer than a hundred cases reported to date. Particularly, cases of Anti-DPPX encephalitis presenting with delayed myoclonus and blurred vision are extremely rare. This case report emphasizes the complexity of the diagnosis and the effective treatment of Anti-DPPX encephalitis with delayed myoclonus. The patient experienced intermittent fever accompanied by severe headaches for one month, with headaches worsening in an upright position, followed by two hours of vomiting, with stomach contents being expelled. Upon admission, the preliminary diagnosis included suspected central nervous system infection and suspected autoimmune encephalitis. Despite receiving anti-infective and antiviral treatments, as well as acid suppressant and gastric protection therapies, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate. Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no apparent abnormalities. Further cerebrospinal fluid and serum tests revealed the presence of anti-DPPX antibodies, confirming the diagnosis of Anti-DPPX encephalitis. The patient underwent a comprehensive treatment regimen, including high-dose steroid pulse therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin, antiviral and anti-infective therapy, as well as acid suppressant and gastric protection treatments. Significant symptom improvement was observed, and by the 8th day of hospitalization, the condition had stabilized. In the 8th month of follow-up, the patient suddenly developed persistent tremor in both hands, without obvious cause. without a recurrence of fever or consciousness disturbances. Steroid therapy was restarted in combination with eculizumab, which was later switched to ofatumumab treatment. The patient's symptoms improved compared to before, and re-examination showed DPPX antibody titers had turned negative. Two months post-discharge, follow-up continued, and the patient's family reported that the tremors persisted, affecting daily life and studies. The current patient is the first reported case of Anti-DPPX encephalitis presenting with delayed tremor accompanied by blurred vision. The patient's condition was quite fluctuating, which led us to discuss the diversity of symptoms as related to extrapyramidal and occipital lobe damage caused by immune-mediated inflammation. Symptom improvement was achieved through a combination of IVMP, eculizumab, and ofatumumab treatments. The prodromal symptoms of Anti-DPPX encephalitis are easily misdiagnosed as infectious diseases due to the heterogeneity of its clinical manifestations. Early identification of the antibody and initiation of immunotherapy can improve the prognosis.

**Authors:** Natalie C Benda, Ruth M Masterson Creber, Roberta Scheinmann, Stephanie Nino de Rivera, Eric Costa Pimentel, Robin B Kalish, Laura E Riley, Alison Hermann, Jessica S Ancker

**Abstract:** The overall goal of this work is to create a patient-reported outcome (PRO) and decision support system to help postpartum patients determine when to seek care for concerning symptoms. In this case study, we assessed differences in perspectives for application design needs based on race, ethnicity, and preferred language. A sample of 446 participants who reported giving birth in the past 12 months was recruited from an existing survey panel. We sampled participants from four self-reported demographic groups: (1) English-speaking panel, Black/African American race, non-Hispanic ethnicity; (2) Spanish-speaking panel, Hispanic-ethnicity; (3) English-speaking panel, Hispanic ethnicity; (4) English-speaking panel, non-Black race, non-Hispanic ethnicity. Participants provided survey-based feedback regarding interest in using the application, comfort reporting symptoms, desired frequency of reporting, reporting tool features, and preferred outreach pathway for concerning symptoms. Fewer Black participants, compared with all other groups, stated that they had used an app for reporting symptoms (

### 37. The noisy encoding of disparity model predicts perception of the McGurk effect in native Japanese speakers.
**Authors:** John F Magnotti, Anastasia Lado, Michael S Beauchamp

**Abstract:** In the McGurk effect, visual speech from the face of the talker alters the perception of auditory speech. The diversity of human languages has prompted many intercultural studies of the effect in both Western and non-Western cultures, including native Japanese speakers. Studies of large samples of native English speakers have shown that the McGurk effect is characterized by high variability in the susceptibility of different individuals to the illusion and in the strength of different experimental stimuli to induce the illusion. The noisy encoding of disparity (NED) model of the McGurk effect uses principles from Bayesian causal inference to account for this variability, separately estimating the susceptibility and sensory noise for each individual and the strength of each stimulus. To determine whether variation in McGurk perception is similar between Western and non-Western cultures, we applied the NED model to data collected from 80 native Japanese-speaking participants. Fifteen different McGurk stimuli that varied in syllable content (unvoiced auditory "pa"â€‰+â€‰visual "ka" or voiced auditory "ba"â€‰+â€‰visual "ga") were presented interleaved with audiovisual congruent stimuli. The McGurk effect was highly variable across stimuli and participants, with the percentage of illusory fusion responses ranging from 3 to 78% across stimuli and from 0 to 91% across participants. Despite this variability, the NED model accurately predicted perception, predicting fusion rates for individual stimuli with 2.1% error and for individual participants with 2.4% error. Stimuli containing the unvoiced pa/ka pairing evoked more fusion responses than the voiced ba/ga pairing. Model estimates of sensory noise were correlated with participant age, with greater sensory noise in older participants. The NED model of the McGurk effect offers a principled way to account for individual and stimulus differences when examining the McGurk effect in different cultures.

### 38. MarkVCID cerebral small vessel consortium: I. Enrollment, clinical, fluid protocols.
**Authors:** Donna Wilcock, Gregory Jicha, Deborah Blacker, Marilyn S Albert, Lina M D'Orazio, Fanny M Elahi, Myriam Fornage, Jason D Hinman, Janice Knoefel, Joel Kramer, Richard J Kryscio, Melissa Lamar, Abhay Moghekar, Jillian Prestopnik, John M Ringman, Gary Rosenberg, Abhay Sagare, Claudia L Satizabal, Julie Schneider, Sudha Seshadri, Sandeepa Sur, Russell P Tracy, Sevil Yasar, Victoria Williams, Herpreet Singh, Lidiya Mazina, Karl G Helmer, Roderick A Corriveau, Kristin Schwab, Pia KivisÃ¤kk, Steven M Greenberg

**Abstract:** The concept of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) derives from more than two decades of research indicating that (1) most older individuals with cognitive impairment have post mortem evidence of multiple contributing pathologies and (2) along with the preeminent role of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, cerebrovascular disease accounts for a substantial proportion of this contribution. Contributing cerebrovascular processes include both overt strokes caused by etiologies such as large vessel occlusion, cardioembolism, and embolic infarcts of unknown source, and frequently asymptomatic brain injuries caused by diseases of the small cerebral vessels. Cerebral small vessel diseases such as arteriolosclerosis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, when present at moderate or greater pathologic severity, are independently associated with worse cognitive performance and greater likelihood of dementia, particularly in combination with AD and other neurodegenerative pathologies. Based on this evidence, the US National Alzheimer's Project Act explicitly authorized accelerated research in vascular and mixed dementia along with frontotemporal and Lewy body dementia and AD itself. Biomarker development has been consistently identified as a key step toward translating scientific advances in VCID into effective prevention and treatment strategies. Validated biomarkers can serve a range of purposes in trials of candidate interventions, including (1) identifying individuals at increased VCID risk, (2) diagnosing the presence of cerebral small vessel disease or specific small vessel pathologies, (3) stratifying study participants according to their prognosis for VCID progression or treatment response, (4) demonstrating an intervention's target engagement or pharmacodynamic mechanism of action, and (5) monitoring disease progression during treatment. Effective biomarkers allow academic and industry investigators to advance promising interventions at early stages of development and discard interventions with low success likelihood. The MarkVCID consortium was formed in 2016 with the goal of developing and validating fluid- and imaging-based biomarkers for the cerebral small vessel diseases associated with VCID. MarkVCID consists of seven project sites and a central coordinating center, working with the National Institute of Neurologic Diseases and Stroke and National Institute on Aging under cooperative agreements. Through an internal selection process, MarkVCID has identified a panel of 11 candidate biomarker "kits" (consisting of the biomarker measure and the clinical and cognitive data used to validate it) and established a range of harmonized procedures and protocols for participant enrollment, clinical and cognitive evaluation, collection and handling of fluid samples, acquisition of neuroimaging studies, and biomarker validation. The overarching goal of these protocols is to generate rigorous validating data that could be used by investigators throughout the research community in selecting and applying biomarkers to multi-site VCID trials. Key features of MarkVCID participant enrollment, clinical/cognitive testing, and fluid biomarker procedures are summarized here, with full details in the following text, tables, and supplemental material, and a description of the MarkVCID imaging biomarker procedures in a companion paper, "MarkVCID Cerebral small vessel consortium: II. Neuroimaging protocols." The procedures described here address a range of challenges in MarkVCID's design, notably: (1) acquiring all data under informed consent and enrollment procedures that allow unlimited sharing and open-ended analyses without compromising participant privacy rights; (2) acquiring the data in a sufficiently wide range of study participants to allow assessment of candidate biomarkers across the various patient groups who might ultimately be targeted in VCID clinical trials; (3) defining a common dataset of clinical and cognitive elements that contains all the key outcome markers and covariates for VCID studies and is realistically obtainable during a practical study visit; (4) instituting best fluid-handling practices for minimizing avoidable sources of variability; and (5) establishing rigorous procedures for testing the reliability of candidate fluid-based biomarkers across replicates, assay runs, sites, and time intervals (collectively defined as the biomarker's instrumental validity). Participant Enrollment Project sites enroll diverse study cohorts using site-specific inclusion and exclusion criteria so as to provide generalizable validation data across a range of cognitive statuses, risk factor profiles, small vessel disease severities, and racial/ethnic characteristics representative of the diverse patient groups that might be enrolled in a future VCID trial. MarkVCID project sites include both prospectively enrolling centers and centers providing extant data and samples from preexisting community- and population-based studies. With approval of local institutional review boards, all sites incorporate MarkVCID consensus language into their study documents and informed consent agreements. The consensus language asks prospectively enrolled participants to consent to unrestricted access to their data and samples for research analysis within and outside MarkVCID. The data are transferred and stored as a de-identified dataset as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule. Similar human subject protection and informed consent language serve as the basis for MarkVCID Research Agreements that act as contracts and data/biospecimen sharing agreements across the consortium. Clinical and Cognitive Data Clinical and cognitive data are collected across prospectively enrolling project sites using common MarkVCID instruments. The clinical data elements are modified from study protocols already in use such as the Alzheimer's Disease Center program Uniform Data Set Version 3 (UDS3), with additional focus on VCID-related items such as prior stroke and cardiovascular disease, vascular risk factors, focal neurologic findings, and blood testing for vascular risk markers and kidney function including hemoglobin A1c, cholesterol subtypes, triglycerides, and creatinine. Cognitive assessments and rating instruments include the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, and most of the UDS3 neuropsychological battery. The cognitive testing requires â‰ˆ60 to 90 minutes. Study staff at the prospectively recruiting sites undergo formalized training in all measures and review of their first three UDS3 administrations by the coordinating center. Collection and Handling of Fluid Samples Fluid sample types collected for MarkVCID biomarker kits are serum, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-plasma, platelet-poor plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with additional collection of packed cells to allow future DNA extraction and analyses. MarkVCID fluid guidelines to minimize variability include fasting morning fluid collections, rapid processing, standardized handling and storage, and avoidance of CSF contact with polystyrene. Instrumental Validation for Fluid-Based Biomarkers Instrumental validation of MarkVCID fluid-based biomarkers is operationally defined as determination of intra-plate and inter-plate repeatability, inter-site reproducibility, and test-retest repeatability. MarkVCID study participants both with and without advanced small vessel disease are selected for these determinations to assess instrumental validity across the full biomarker assay range. Intra- and inter-plate repeatability is determined by repeat assays of single split fluid samples performed at individual sites. Inter-site reproducibility is determined by assays of split samples distributed to multiple sites. Test-retest repeatability is determined by assay of three samples acquired from the same individual, collected at least 5 days apart over a 30-day period and assayed on a single plate. The MarkVCID protocols are designed to allow direct translation of the biomarker validation results to multicenter trials. They also provide a template for outside groups to perform analyses using identical methods and therefore allow direct comparison of results across studies and centers. All MarkVCID protocols are available to the biomedical community and intended to be shared. In addition to the instrumental validation procedures described here, each of the MarkVCID kits will undergo biological validation to determine whether the candidate biomarker measures important aspects of VCID such as cognitive function. Analytic methods and results of these validation studies for the 11 MarkVCID biomarker kits will be published separately. The results of this rigorous validation process will ultimately determine each kit's potential usefulness for multicenter interventional trials aimed at preventing or treating small vessel disease related VCID.

### 39. Nivolumab for adults with Hodgkin's lymphoma (a rapid review using the software RobotReviewer).
**Authors:** Marius Goldkuhle, Maria Dimaki, Gerald Gartlehner, Ina Monsef, Philipp Dahm, Jan-Peter Glossmann, Andreas Engert, Bastian von Tresckow, Nicole Skoetz

**Abstract:** Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is a cancer of the lymphatic system, and involves the lymph nodes, spleen and other organs such as the liver, lung, bone or bone marrow, depending on the tumour stage. With cure rates of up to 90%, HL is one of the most curable cancers worldwide. Approximately 10% of people with HL will be refractory to initial treatment or will relapse; this is more common in people with advanced stage or bulky disease. Standard of care for these people is high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), but only 55% of participants treated with high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT are free from treatment failure at three years, with an overall survival (OS) of about 80% at three years.Checkpoint inhibitors that target the interaction of the programmed death (PD)-1 immune checkpoint receptor, and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, have shown remarkable activity in a wide range of malignancies. Nivolumab is an anti-(PD)-1 monoclonal antibody and currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma and, since 2016, for classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL) after treatment with ASCT and brentuximab vedotin. To assess the benefits and harms of nivolumab in adults with HL (irrespective of stage of disease). We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, conference proceedings and six study registries from January 2000 to May 2018 for prospectively planned trials evaluating nivolumab. We included prospectively planned trials evaluating nivolumab in adults with HL. We excluded trials in which less than 80% of participants had HL, unless the trial authors provided the subgroup data for these participants in the publication or after we contacted the trial authors. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed potential risk of bias. We used the software RobotReviewer to extract data and compared results with our findings. As we did not identify any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non-RCTs, we did not meta-analyse data. Our search found 782 potentially relevant references. From these, we included three trials without a control group, with 283 participants. In addition, we identified 14 ongoing trials evaluating nivolumab, of which two are randomised. Risk of bias of the three included studies was moderate to high. All of the participants were in relapsed stage, most of them were heavily pretreated and had received at least two previous treatments, most of them had also undergone ASCT. As we did not identify any RCTs, we could not use the software RobotReviewer to assess risk of bias. The software identified correctly that one study was not an RCT and did not extract any trial data, but extracted characteristics of the other two studies (although also not RCTs) in a sufficient way.Two studies with 260 participants evaluated OS. After six months, OS was 100% in one study and median OS (the timepoint when only 50% of participants were alive) was not reached in the other trial after a median follow-up of 18 months (interquartile range (IQR) 15 to 22 months) (very low certainty evidence, due to observational trial design, heterogenous patient population in terms of pretreatments and various follow-up times (downgrading by 1 point)). In one study, one out of three cohorts reported quality of life. It was unclear whether there was an effect on quality of life as only a subset of participants filled out the follow-up questionnaire (very low certainty evidence). Three trials (283 participants) evaluated progression-free survival (PFS) (very low certainty evidence). Six-month PFS ranged between 60% and 86%, and median PFS ranged between 12 and 18 months. All three trials (283 participants) reported complete response rates, ranging from 12% to 29%, depending on inclusion criteria and participants' previous treatments (very low certainty evidence).One trial (243 participants) reported drug-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) only after a median follow-up of 18 months (IQR 15 to 22 months); these were fatigue (23%), diarrhoea (15%), infusion reactions (14%) and rash (12%). The other two trials (40 participants) reported 23% to 52% grade 3 or 4 AEs after six months' follow-up (very low certainty evidence). Only one trial (243 participants) reported drug-related serious AEs; 2% of participants developed infusion reactions and 1% pneumonitis (very low certainty evidence).None of the studies reported treatment-related mortality. To date, data on OS, quality of life, PFS, response rate, or short- and long-term AEs are available from small uncontrolled trials only. The three trials included heavily pretreated participants, which had previously undergone regimens of BV or ASCT. For these participants, median OS was not reached after follow-up times of at least 16 months (more than 50% of participants with a limited life expectancy were alive at this timepoint). Only one cohort out of three only reported quality of life, with limited follow-up data so that meaningful conclusions were not possible. Serious adverse events occurred rarely. Currently, data are too sparse to make a clear statement on nivolumab for people with relapsed or refractory HL except for heavily pretreated people, which had previously undergone regimens of BV or ASCT. When interpreting these results, it is important to consider that proper RCTs should confirm these findings.As there are 14 ongoing trials evaluating nivolumab, of which two are RCTs, it is possible that an update of this review will be published in the near future and that this update will show different results to those reported here.

### 40. Topical clonidine for neuropathic pain in adults.
**Authors:** Wojciech T Serednicki, Anna Wrzosek, Jaroslaw Woron, Jaroslaw Garlicki, Jan Dobrogowski, Joanna Jakowicka-Wordliczek, Jerzy Wordliczek, Renata Zajaczkowska

**Abstract:** Clonidine is a presynaptic alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist that has been used for many years to treat hypertension and other conditions, including chronic pain. Adverse events associated with systemic use of the drug have limited its application. Topical use of drugs has been gaining interest since the beginning of the century, as it may limit adverse events without loss of analgesic efficacy. Topical clonidine (TC) formulations have been investigated for almost 20 years in clinical trials. This is an update of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 8, 2015. The objective of this review was to assess the analgesic efficacy and safety of TC compared with placebo or other drugs in adults aged 18 years or above with chronic neuropathic pain. For this update we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO), MEDLINE (Ovid), and Embase (Ovid) databases, and reference lists of retrieved papers and trial registries. We also contacted experts in the field. The most recent search was performed on 27 October 2021. We included randomised, double-blind studies of at least two weeks' duration comparing TC versus placebo or other active treatment in adults with chronic neuropathic pain. Two review authors independently screened references for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by consulting a third review author if necessary. Where required, we contacted trial authors to request additional information. We presented pooled estimates for dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs) with P values. We used Review Manager Web software to perform the meta-analyses. We used a fixed-effect model if we considered heterogeneity as not important; otherwise, we used a random-effects model.Â  The review primary outcomes were: participant-reported pain relief of 50% or greater; participant-reported pain relief of 30% or greater; much or very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC); and very much improved on PGIC. Secondary outcomes included withdrawals due to adverse events; participants experiencing at least one adverse event; and withdrawals due to lack of efficacy. All outcomes were measured at the longest follow-up period. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE and created two summary of findings tables. We included four studies in the review (two new in this update), with a total of 743 participants with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). TC (0.1% or 0.2%) was applied in gel form to the painful area two to three times daily. The double-blind treatment phase of three studiesÂ lasted 8 weeks to 85 days and compared TC versus placebo. In the fourth study, the double-blind treatment phase lasted 12 weeks and compared TC versus topical capsaicin. We assessed the studies as at unclear or high risk of bias for most domains; all studies were at unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessment; one study was at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel; two studies were at high risk of attrition bias; and three studies were at high risk of bias due to notable funding concerns. We judged the certainty of evidence (GRADE) to be moderate to very low, downgrading for study limitations, imprecision of results, and publication bias. TC compared to placebo There was no evidence of a difference in number of participants withÂ participant-reported pain relief of 50% or greaterÂ during longest follow-up period (12 weeks) between groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.86; 179 participants; 1Â study; low certainty evidence). However, the number of participants with participant-reported pain relief of 30% or greaterÂ during longest follow-up period (8 to 12 weeks) was higher in the TC group compared with placebo (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.77; 344 participants; 2 studies, very low certainty evidence).Â The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) for this comparison was 8.33 (95% CI 4.3 to 50.0). Also, there was no evidence of a difference between groups for the outcomes much or very much improved on the PGICÂ during longest follow-up period (12 weeks) or very much improved on PGIC during the longest follow-up period (12 weeks) (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.49 and RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.72, respectively; 179 participants; 1 study; low certainty evidence). We observed no evidence of a difference between groups in withdrawals due to adverse events and withdrawals due to lack of efficacy during the longest follow-up period (12 weeks) (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.18Â and RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.92, respectively; 179 participants; 1 study; low certainty evidence) and participants experiencing at least one adverse event during longest follow-up period (12 weeks) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.14 to 3.05; 344 participants; 2 studies; low certainty evidence).Â  TC compared to active comparator There was no evidence of a difference in the number of participants withÂ participant-reported pain relief of 50% or greaterÂ during longest follow-up period (12 weeks) between groups (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.0; 139 participants; 1Â study; low certainty evidence). Other outcomes were not reported. This is an update of a review published in 2015, for which our conclusions remain unchanged. Topical clonidine may provide some benefit to adults with painful diabetic neuropathy; however, the evidence is very uncertain. Additional trials are needed to assess TC in other neuropathic pain conditions and to determine whether it is possible to predict who or which groups of people will benefit from TC.

### 41. [Volume and health outcomes: evidence from systematic reviews and from evaluation of Italian hospital data].
**Authors:** Laura Amato, Paola Colais, Marina Davoli, Eliana Ferroni, Danilo Fusco, Silvia Minozzi, Fulvio Moirano, Paolo Sciattella, Simona Vecchi, Martina Ventura, Carlo Alberto Perucci

**Abstract:** Improving quality and effectiveness of health care is one of the priorities of health policies. Hospital or physician volume represents a measurable variable with a relevant impact on effectiveness of health care. A recent Italian law, the "spending review", calls for the definition of "qualitative, structural, technological and quantitative standards of hospital care". There is a need for an accurate evaluation of the available scientific evidence in order to identify these standards, including the volume of care above or below which the public and private hospitals may be accredited (or not) to provide specific health care interventions. Since 2009, the National Outcomes Programme evaluates outcomes of care of the Italian hospitals; nowadays it represents an official tool to assess the National Health System (NHS). In addition to outcome indicators, the last edition of the Programme (2013) includes a set of volume indicators for the conditions with available evidence of an association between volume and outcome. The assessment of factors, such as volume, that may affect the outcomes of care is one of its objectives. To identify clinical conditions or interventions for which an association between volume and outcome has been investigated. To identify clinical conditions or interventions for which an association between volume and outcome has been proved. To analyse the distribution of Italian health providers by volume of activity. To measure the association between volume of care and outcomes of the health providers of the Italian NHS. Systematic review. An overview of systematic reviews and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) reports performed searching electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library), websites of HTA Agencies, National Guideline Clearinghouse up to February 2012. Studies were evaluated for inclusion by two researchers independently; the quality assessment of included reviews was performed using the AMSTAR checklist. For each health condition and for each outcome considered, total number of studies, participants, high volume cut-off values (range, average and median) have been reported, where presented. Number of studies (and participants) with statistically significant positive association and metanalysis performed were also reported, if available. Analysis of the distribution of Italian hospitals by volume of activity and the association between volume of activity and outcomes. Outcomes National Programme 2011 The analyses were performed using the Hospital Information System and the National Tax Register pertaining the year 2011. For each condition, the number of hospitals by volume of activity was calculated. Hospitals with a volume of activity lower than 3-5 cases/year for the condition under study were excluded from the analysis. For conditions with more than 1,500 cases per year and frequency of outcome â‰¥ 3%, the association between volume of care and outcome was analysed. For these conditions, risk-adjusted outcomes were estimated according to the selection criteria and the statistical methodology of the National Outcome Programme. The systematic reviews identified were 107, of which 47, evaluating 38 clinical areas, were included. Many outcomes were assessed according to the clinical condition/procedure considered. The main outcome common to all clinical condition/procedures was intrahospital/30-day mortality. Health topics were classified in the following groups according to this outcome: Positive association: a statistically significant positive association was demonstrated in the majority of studies/participants and/or a pooled measure (metanalysis) with positive results was reported. Lack of association: no association was demonstrated in the majority of studies/participants and/or no metanalysis with positive results was reported. No sufficient evidence of association: both results of single studies and metanalysis do not allow to draw firm conclusions on the association between volume and outcome. Evidence of a positive association between volumes and intrahospital/ 30-day mortality was demonstrated for 26 clinical areas: AIDS, abdominal aortic aneurysm (ruptured and unruptured), coronary angioplasty, myocardial infarction, knee arthroplasty, coronary artery bypass, cancer surgery (breast, lung, colon, colon rectum, kidney, liver, stomach, bladder, oesophagus, pancreas, prostate); cholecystectomy, brain aneurysm, carotid endarterectomy, hip fracture, lower extremity bypass surgery, subarachnoid haemorrhage, neonatal intensive care, paediatric heart surgery. For 2 clinical conditions (hip arthroplasty and rectal cancer surgery) no association has been reported. Due to a lack of evidence, it was not possible to draw firm conclusion for 10 clinical areas (appendectomy, colectomy, aortofemoral bypass, testicle cancer surgery, cardiac catheterization, trauma, hysterectomy, inguinal hernia, paediatric oncology). The relationship between volume of clinician and outcomes has been assessed only through the literature review; to date, it is not possible to analyse this association for Italian health providers hospitals, since information on the clinician/surgeon on the hospital discharge chart is missing. The literature found a positive association for: AIDS, coronary angioplasty, unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, hip arthroplasty, coronary artery bypass, cancer surgery (colon, stomach, bladder, breast, oesophagus), lower extremity bypass surgery. The analysis of the distribution of Italian hospitals per volume of activity concerned the 26 conditions for which the systematic review has shown a positive association between volume of activity and intrahospital/30-day mortality. For the following conditions it was possible to conduct the analysis of the association between volume and outcome of treatment using national data: unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, coronary angioplasty, knee arthroplasty, coronary artery bypass, cancer surgery (colon, pancreas, lung, prostate, stomach, bladder), laparoscopic cholecystectomy, endarterectomy, hip fracture and acute myocardial infarction. For them, the association between volume and outcome of care has been observed. The shape of the relationship is variable among different conditions, with heterogeneous "slope" of the curves. DISCUSSION For many conditions, the systematic review of the literature has shown a strong evidence of association between higher volumes and better outcomes. Due to the difficulty to test such an association in randomized controlled studies, the studies included in the reviews were mainly observational studies: however, the quality of the available evidence can be considered good both for the consistency of the results between the studies and for the strength of the association. Where national data had sufficient statistical power, this association has been observed by the empirical analysis conducted on the health providers of the NHS in 2011. Analysing national data, potential confounders, including age and the presence of comorbidities in the admission under study and in the admissions of the two previous years, have been considered. The systematic review of the literature does not permit to identify predefined volume thresholds. The analysis of national data shows a strong improvement in outcomes in the first part of the curve (from very low volumes to higher volumes) for the majority of the studied conditions. In some cases the improvement in outcomes remains gradual or constant with the increasing volume of care, in other the analysis could allow the identification of threshold values beyond which the outcome does not improve further. However, a good knowledge of the relationship between effectiveness of treatments and their costs, the geographical distribution and the accessibility to health care services are necessary to choose the minimum volumes of care, under which specific health procedures in the NHS should not be provided. Some potential biases due to the use of information systems data should also be taken into account. In particular, it is necessary to consider possible selection bias due to the different way of coding among hospitals that could lead to a different selection of cases for some conditions (e.g. acute myocardial infarction), less likely to occur in the selection of cases for oncologic, orthopaedic, vascular, abdominal, and cardiac surgery. Regarding the definition of the exposure (volume of care), a possible bias could result from misclassification of health providers with high volume of activity. In fact, performing the intervention in different departments/units of the same hospital would result in an overestimation of the volume of care measured for hospital rather than for department/unit. A similar bias could occur if the main determinant of the outcome of treatment was the case load of each surgeon: the results of the analysis may be biased when the same procedure was carried out by different operators in the same hospital/unit. In any case, the observed association between volumes of care and outcome is very strong, and it is unlikely to be attributable to biases of the study design. However, the foreseen bias is likely to be non-differential, and, therefore, it would eventually lead to an underestimation of the true association between volume of care and outcome. Health systems operate, by definition, in a context of limited resources, especially when societies and governments choose to reduce the amount of resources to allocate to the health system. In such conditions, the rationalisation of the organization of health services based on the volume of care may make resources available to improve the effectiveness of interventions. The identification and certification of services and provider with high volume of activity can help to reduce differences in the access to no effective procedures.
