## Introduction

Preeclampsia is a multifactorial hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, characterized by the onset of elevated blood pressure and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation [ 1 ]. Preeclampsia affects about 5–8% of pregnancies globally and poses significant risks to both mother and fetus, leading to complications, such as preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, and, in severe cases, maternal and fetal mortality [ 2 ]. Preeclampsia continues to be a major contributor to maternal illness and death, especially in low-income regions where delayed diagnosis and limited access to treatment are common [ 3 ]. Although the exact cause of preeclampsia is not fully understood, it is believed to result from a combination of genetic, environmental, and immune factors, along with their complex interactions [ 4 ]. Epidemiologically, preeclampsia tends to occur more frequently in specific population groups [ 1 ]. Women are at higher risk of developing preeclampsia if they have a history of the condition in a previous pregnancy, are carrying multiple fetuses, or have pre-existing conditions such as chronic hypertension or diabetes. Advanced maternal age (≥ 35 years) also increases susceptibility. Socioeconomic factors, particularly limited access to healthcare, can further elevate the risk and exacerbate the disease burden. Additionally, growing evidence indicates that maternal obesity and metabolic disorders are contributing significantly to the rising incidence of preeclampsia in recent years [ 5 ]. Women are at higher risk of developing preeclampsia if they have a history of the condition in a previous pregnancy, are carrying multiple fetuses, or have pre-existing conditions such as chronic hypertension or diabetes. Advanced maternal age (≥ 35 years) also increases susceptibility. Socioeconomic factors, particularly limited access to healthcare, can further elevate the risk and exacerbate the disease burden. Additionally, growing evidence indicates that maternal obesity and metabolic disorders are contributing significantly to the rising incidence of preeclampsia in recent years [ 6 ]. Severe preeclampsia is often characterized not only by maternal organ dysfunction but also by complications such as HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count), eclampsia, and placental abruption [ 7 ]. The underlying pathophysiology of preeclampsia is thought to stem from inadequate trophoblastic invasion and poor uteroplacental perfusion, resulting in placental ischemia. This, in turn, triggers systemic endothelial dysfunction, widespread inflammation, and elevated blood pressure [ 8 ]. Although diagnostic criteria and screening tools are available, early detection and prediction of preeclampsia remain challenging in obstetric care. Blood pressure and proteinuria are key diagnostic markers, yet they are often ineffective for identifying at-risk women in the initial stages of the condition [ 9 ]. This has led to growing interest in identifying novel biomarkers capable of predicting preeclampsia before clinical symptoms emerge. Advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved, especially the role of adipokines and their relationship to gene expression in placental and adipose tissues, holds promise for improving the prediction, prevention, and management of preeclampsia [ 10 ]. Previous studies have suggested that elevated plasma levels of adipokines, bioactive molecules secreted by adipose tissue, may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia [ 11 ]. Adipokines like leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and others play key regulatory roles in vascular function, inflammation, and insulin sensitivity, processes that are notably disrupted in preeclampsia [ 12 ]. Specifically, alterations in adipokine expression within the placenta and adipose tissue during pregnancy may enhance our understanding of the link between maternal obesity and the metabolic disturbances contributing to preeclampsia. These molecular changes also hold potential as early biomarkers, enabling timely detection and intervention to improve clinical outcomes [ 13 ].

The pathophysiological relationship between adipokine regulation and preeclampsia remains complex and warrants further investigation. Emerging evidence indicates that abnormal adipokine levels may alter placental development and function, contributing to the vascular abnormalities characteristic of preeclampsia [ 14 ]. For instance, elevated leptin levels have been linked to increased vascular resistance and endothelial dysfunction, while simultaneously suppressing adiponectin, a key adipokine with anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory properties, thereby promoting hypertension through an intensified inflammatory response [ 15 ]. Moreover, adipokines can modulate immune responses by altering the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, a mechanism that plays a significant role in the development of preeclampsia [ 16 ]. This review examines elevated adipokine levels in preeclampsia and their association with gene expression in placental and adipose tissues. By exploring their role in disease pathophysiology, we provide a comprehensive overview of how disrupted adipokine signaling contributes to preeclampsia and assess their potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Understanding these molecular mechanisms may also support the development of therapies targeting adipokine pathways to improve pregnancy outcomes. Given the rapid onset and late presentation of preeclampsia, early biomarker identification is essential for better maternal and fetal care [ 17 ]. Timely monitoring and intervention are crucial to prevent serious complications, including maternal organ damage, fetal growth restriction, or even mortality. Reliable biomarkers capable of predicting preeclampsia before clinical symptoms appear would enable healthcare providers to closely monitor high-risk pregnancies and implement early preventive measures, such as low-dose aspirin or more frequent prenatal evaluations [ 18 ]. Biomarkers serve multiple functions beyond early disease detection. They can also reflect the severity and progression of preeclampsia throughout pregnancy. Monitoring specific biomarker levels over time allows clinicians to assess disease advancement and tailor medical interventions accordingly [ 19 ]. Certain biomarkers may indicate placental dysfunction or endothelial damage, both key components of preeclampsia pathophysiology. Monitoring these markers can offer valuable insight into the degree of vascular involvement and assist clinicians in determining if early delivery is necessary to improve maternal and fetal outcomes [ 19 ]. Biomarkers have value beyond diagnosis and monitoring; they may also serve as prognostic tools. Identifying women at risk of developing severe forms of preeclampsia, such as HELLP syndrome or eclampsia, can guide clinical decisions on the timing and mode of delivery, as well as the implementation of interventions to protect maternal and fetal health [ 2 ]. Adipokines, which play key roles in regulating metabolism and immune function, have emerged as promising biomarkers in the pathogenesis and progression of preeclampsia. These metabolic regulators may serve as early indicators of the condition and provide valuable insights into treatment response [ 20 ].

Ultimately, investigating early biomarkers could drive the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting pathways involved in preeclampsia. Gaining insight into the molecular mechanisms—particularly those linked to adipokine dysregulation—may open avenues for interventions that delay or prevent disease onset. Such advancements would enhance maternal and fetal health, reduce the healthcare burden, and improve overall maternal outcomes.

## Adipokines: overview and biological roles

Adipokines are bioactive lipophilic molecules secreted by adipose tissue, and they play a critical role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis, inflammation, immune responses, and cardiovascular health [ 21 ]. Adipokines are involved in complex signaling mechanisms that affect insulin sensitivity, energy metabolism, and cardiovascular function. The production and function of adipokines are profoundly affected during pregnancy to support maternal metabolic adaptation and fetal growth. However, dysregulation of the adipokine levels is often encountered in pregnancy disorders like preeclampsia, where the disturbed metabolic and inflammatory setting is the cause of the disease pathophysiology [ 22 ].

Adiponectin, a potent adipokine, is vasoprotective and anti-inflammatory. It is a key molecule in promoting insulin sensitivity and the regulation of inflammation by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and blocking the NF-κB pathway [ 23 ]. During normal pregnancy, adiponectin decreases as a function of compensations for increased insulin resistance. Underlying molecular processes involve diminished activation of vascular and placental tissue adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2), as well as additional impairments of vascular integrity [ 24 ].

Resistin, a pro-inflammatory adipokine, is typically found to be increased in preeclampsia. Resistin acts to modulate the immune response by inducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6 through the activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/NF-κB signaling pathway [ 25 ]. These mechanisms lead to systemic inflammation and can exacerbate placental dysfunction. Elevated resistin has been associated with insulin resistance in preeclampsia, thus establishing another link between metabolic dysregulation and disease progression [ 26 ]. Resistin also negatively impacts endothelial function by increasing oxidative stress, reducing nitric oxide availability, and increasing vascular permeability [ 27 ].

Other adipokines, including visfatin, chemerin, and omentin, have changed expression patterns in the context of preeclampsia. Visfatin, also an insulin-mimetic adipokine, has elevated levels in preeclampsia and contributes to endothelial dysfunction through enhanced vascular smooth muscle proliferation and induction of oxidative stress [ 28 ]. Chemerin, also referred to as a pro-inflammatory adipokine, is linked to elevated vascular resistance and compromised angiogenesis, possibly through activation of ChemR23 receptors. Conversely, omentin, also referred to as an anti-inflammatory adipokine, is frequently decreased in preeclampsia, thereby decreasing its protective influence on endothelial function and insulin sensitivity [ 29 ].

The adipokine dysregulation in preeclampsia is intimately related to gene expression changes in the placenta and adipose tissue. The placenta, a significant source of adipokines during pregnancy, has changed gene expression patterns in preeclampsia under hypoxia and oxidative stress [ 30 ]. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), increased in the hypoxic condition of the preeclamptic placenta, increase the secretion of pro-inflammatory adipokines such as leptin and resistin but inhibit anti-inflammatory adipokines such as adiponectin [ 31 , 32 ]. Concurrently, maternal adipose tissue is modified by adipokine gene expression due to systemic inflammation and metabolic stress. These molecular changes point to the interaction between the placenta and fat tissue in influencing the adipokine pattern found in preeclampsia [ 33 ].

Concurrently, there are changes in adipokine gene expression in maternal adipose tissue, governed by systemic inflammation and metabolic distress. These molecular changes provide evidence of interactive dynamics between the placenta and adipose tissue that regulate the adipokine profile, a predictor of preeclampsia [ 33 ].

Figure 1 illustrates the pivotal role of adipokines secreted by adipocytes in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Pro-inflammatory adipokines—including resistin, leptin, visfatin, chemerin, and omentin—activate key intracellular signaling pathways such as JAK/STAT, MAPK, TLR4, and PI3K/Akt. These pathways converge on NF-κB activation, which drives the production of inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and TNF-α, thereby intensifying systemic inflammation. This heightened inflammatory state contributes to endothelial dysfunction and is a central component in the development of preeclampsia. The figure highlights the complex interplay between adipokine signaling and inflammatory cascades that underlie the condition. Dysregulated adipokine expression reflects broader systemic metabolic disturbances, promoting oxidative stress, impairing nitric oxide signaling, and exacerbating vascular inflammation [ 34 ]. Collectively, these molecular disruptions manifest as hallmark clinical features of preeclampsia, including hypertension, proteinuria, and multi-organ involvement. Understanding the molecular underpinnings of adipokine dysregulation offers valuable insights into the etiopathogenesis of preeclampsia and may inform the development of targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Fig. 1 Role of adipokines in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia

These molecules hold a lot of potential as biomarkers for early detection of problems and risk estimation. For example, increased levels of leptin and resistin, and decreased levels of adiponectin, could point to issues such as endothelial dysfunction and placental insufficiency in what would otherwise be high-risk pregnancies [ 35 ]. On the therapeutic front, targeting adipokine signaling pathways may provide novel means of decreasing inflammation and improving vascular health, ultimately leading to better management of preeclampsia in clinical practice.

## Role of adipokines in regulating metabolism, immune response, and inflammation

Adipokines are bioactive adipokines secreted mainly through fat tissue and are crucial for regulating metabolism, the immune system, and inflammation [ 21 ]. These molecules serve as endocrine mediators, coordinate metabolic and immune signaling cascades, and play central roles in maintaining homeostasis. Adipokines also affect key functions, such as glucose metabolism, lipid homeostasis, and vascular function through specific receptor interaction with target cells. Adipokine signaling dysregulation, which is commonly seen in inflammatory and metabolic disorders, underscores its key role in disease pathophysiology [ 42 ].

Molecularly, leptin is an essential controller of energy homeostasis and immune regulation. Through binding with leptin receptors (LEPR), primarily found in the hypothalamus, leptin triggers JAK/STAT and PI3K signaling pathways to reduce appetite and control energy expenditure. In addition to its metabolic function, leptin amplifies immune function by stimulating T-cell activation and cytokine production [ 43 ]. In inflammatory disease, increased levels of leptin further enhance the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6, leading to systemic inflammation and insulin resistance. This dual action emphasizes leptin’s role in metabolic and immune regulation [ 44 ].

Adiponectin, however, is chiefly anti-inflammatory and vasoprotective. Adiponectin improves the sensitivity to insulin by activating the AMPK and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) pathways that augment glucose consumption and fatty acid oxidation [ 45 ]. Adiponectin also influences immunity by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway, suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines expression. Molecularly, adiponectin acts by binding to its receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2), which are ubiquitously present in metabolic and vascular tissues [ 46 ]. This binding improves endothelial function and reduces oxidative stress, making adiponectin a critical molecule in the prevention of chronic inflammation and metabolic abnormalities.

Resistin, yet another adipokine, connects obesity with insulin resistance and inflammation. Adipocytes and immune cells produce it and facilitate pro-inflammatory mechanisms through the activation of TLR4 and the NF-κB signaling cascade [ 47 ]. This leads to the upregulation of cytokines, such as IL-6 and MCP-1, leading to the recruitment of inflammatory cells and enhancement of tissue inflammation. Resistin’s function in disrupting insulin signaling pathways, specifically through the inhibition of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), underscores its role in metabolic dysfunction [ 48 ].

Visfatin, which is secreted mainly by visceral fat, is insulin-mimetic in action and involved in glucose homeostasis. Visfatin activates the insulin receptor and triggers downstream signaling cascades, such as PI3K/Akt, enhancing glucose uptake [ 49 ]. Visfatin is also involved in inflammatory responses, enhancing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and TNF-α. In pathological states, increased visfatin levels could play a role in inducing a pro-inflammatory condition, thus highlighting its dual function in inflammation and metabolism [ 50 ].

Chemerin and omentin also demonstrate the multifunctionality of adipokines in immunological and metabolic control. Chemerin, a pro-inflammatory adipokine, signals through ChemR23 receptors to modulate the chemotaxis of immune cells and vascular remodeling [ 51 ]. Increased levels of chemerin correlate with raised vascular resistance and glucose metabolic impairment. Omentin, however, has anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects by increasing endothelial nitric oxide production and inhibiting inflammatory pathways. The opposing functions of these adipokines emphasize the balance needed for the best metabolic and immune homeostasis [ 52 ].

Adipokines are central controllers of metabolic and immune processes, with their molecular mechanisms closely integrated into inflammation and energy balance. Dysregulation of adipokine signaling is a characteristic of several metabolic and inflammatory diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [ 53 ]. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying adipokine function provides significant insight into their function in health and disease, allowing for therapeutic targeting. Please find the information about the adipokine’s role in Table 1 .

## Mechanisms of adipokine alterations in preeclampsia

Adipokines, mainly produced by fat tissue, are crucial in controlling energy metabolism, the immune response, and vascular homeostasis. Pregnancy, characterized by the enhancement of metabolic and immune needs, promotes adaptation to the needs in adipokines that enhance the exchanges between fetus and mother, while ensuring effective vascular performance [ 21 ]. Still, that sensitive equilibrium in preeclampsia becomes deranged with impaired secretion and plasma levels of specific adipokines. These changes contribute to the disease pathogenesis and provide information regarding its molecular basis [ 14 ].

Conversely, adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory adipokine, demonstrates reduced plasma concentration in preeclampsia. Adiponectin exerts its effects by activating AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 receptors, amplifying AMPK and PPARα signaling pathways [ 54 ]. These pathways diminish oxidative stress and enhance endothelial function. In preeclampsia, low levels of adiponectin correlate with increased oxidative stress and vascular reactivity impairment. Suppression of adiponectin is further associated with augmented NF-κB activity, favoring a pro-inflammatory environment.

Resistin, another critical adipokine, is induced in preeclampsia, which causes systemic inflammation and metabolic derangement. It induces TLR4 and NF-κB signaling pathways, which enhance the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [ 55 ]. Resistin levels are higher and associated with vascular dysfunction, insulin resistance, and increased endothelial permeability, increasing the pathophysiological processes of preeclampsia. Its action reflects the association of adipokine deregulation and vascular pathology through inflammation [ 56 ].

Visfatin, which has insulin-mimetic actions, paradoxically rises during preeclampsia. While visfatin facilitates glucose homeostasis through insulin receptor signaling, increased visfatin during preeclampsia is linked to unfavorable outcomes, such as oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction [ 57 ]. Visfatin induces vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and cytokine secretion, further advancing the deranged vascular function that defines the condition [ 58 ].

The mechanistic diagram portrays the relative functions of adiponectin and leptin in the maternal–fetal–placental axis under varying growth conditions, such as appropriate for gestational age (AGA). Within the maternal compartment, low adiponectin—responsible for insulin sensitivity and nutrient metabolism—negatively impacts the placenta's PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, resulting in compromised glucose and amino acid transfer to the fetus. Likewise, leptin signaling via JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways may be disrupted in response to placental leptin resistance or maternal metabolic distress. These signal alterations contribute to metabolic derangement, inflammatory cytokine secretion (e.g., TNF-α and IL-6), and inadequate placental performance.

Within the fetal compartment, decreased adiponectin and leptin further compromise fetal growth. Low adiponectin inhibits metabolic homeostasis and adipogenesis, whereas decreased fetal leptin reflects impaired fat deposition and might influence hypothalamic formation, essential for long-term energy control. The figure's half green–red arrows schematically contrast the physiological normal process in AGA (green) with abnormal signaling cascades (red). The net outcome is reduced fetal adiposity, impaired growth, and poor neonatal outcomes. This model of integration highlights how dysregulation of adipokines interferes with essential molecular pathways and contributes to adverse developmental outcomes (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 Mechanistic pathways linking maternal and fetal adipokine dysregulation to growth outcomes

Pro-inflammatory adipokine chemerin is also increased in preeclampsia. Chemerin binds to ChemR23 receptors, affecting immune cell recruitment and vascular remodeling [ 40 ]. Increased levels of chemerin impair angiogenesis and enhance vascular resistance, which are essential factors underlying the etiology of placental insufficiency. The chemerin signaling dysfunction indicates its involvement in mediating inflammation with compromised placental perfusion in preeclampsia [ 59 ].

On the other hand, omentin, an anti-inflammatory adipokine, is decreased in preeclampsia. Omentin increases endothelial nitric oxide generation and blunts inflammation, favoring vascular health [ 41 ]. Its lower expression in preeclampsia undermines these protective mechanisms, worsening endothelial function and insulin resistance. This decrease accompanies the pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative state found in the disease [ 60 ].

The placenta is the key to the dysregulation of adipokines in preeclampsia. HIF-1α, induced due to the placenta’s hypoxia, directly modulates the secretion of adipokines like leptin and chemerin but inhibits adiponectin [ 61 , 62 ]. These alterations in adipokine expression are also increased by inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress, forming a feed-forward loop that worsens vascular and metabolic impairments.

The disrupted plasma adipokine levels in preeclampsia represent a complex interplay among placental hypoxia, systemic inflammation, and metabolic stress [ 22 ]. Unraveling these molecular mechanisms sheds light on the pathophysiology of preeclampsia and highlights the potential of adipokines as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Rebalancing adipokines through targeted intervention may be an attractive strategy for preventing the vascular and metabolic comorbidities of preeclampsia [ 63 ].

Adipokines, released mainly by adipose tissue and the placenta during pregnancy, are critical modulators of energy metabolism, immune reactions, and vascular homeostasis [ 63 ]. In preeclampsia, a complex pregnancy disorder characterized by hypertension and multi-organ dysfunction, dysregulation of adipokines is a crucial contributor to pathophysiology [ 64 ]. Increased production of pro-inflammatory adipokines like leptin, resistin, and chemerin, and decreased production of anti-inflammatory adipokines like adiponectin and omentin, are responsible for the development of systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular impairment in preeclampsia [ 22 ]. These molecular imbalances unveil the intricate relationship between adipokines and preeclampsia pathogenesis.

Leptin, a pro-inflammatory adipokine, is significantly increased in preeclampsia. Produced by adipose tissue and the placenta, leptin controls energy balance, vascular remodeling, and immune tolerance during pregnancy. However, in preeclampsia, placental hypoxia stimulates excessive production of leptin [ 65 ]. Leptin triggers JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways, upregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6 [ 66 ]. It enhances endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and vascular resistance, and contributes to preeclampsia’s inflammatory and hypertensive phenotype.

Contrastingly, the anti-inflammatory adipokine adiponectin is significantly diminished in preeclampsia. Adiponectin improves insulin sensitivity and vascular function by stimulating AMPK and PPARα [ 37 ]. The mechanisms counteract oxidative stress and inhibit inflammation through suppression of NF-κB signaling. Preeclampsia’s adiponectin downregulation removes its protective function, leading to increased endothelial damage and metabolic dysregulation. Low adiponectin levels have also been linked with defective trophoblast invasion, one of the defining features of placental dysfunction in preeclampsia [ 67 ].

Resistin, another adipokine involved in preeclampsia, connects inflammation with metabolic impairment. Increased resistin levels activate TLR4 and NF-κB signaling pathways, increasing cytokine production such as IL-6 and MCP-1 [ 68 ]. This induces systemic inflammation, endothelial activation, and vascular leakage, which are the main characteristics of preeclampsia. Resistin also interferes with insulin signaling by inhibiting the glucose transporter GLUT4, further exacerbating metabolic derangements [ 69 ].

Chemerin and visfatin, pro-inflammatory adipokines, also contribute to the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. Chemerin, via its receptor ChemR23, regulates immune cell chemotaxis and vascular remodeling. High levels of chemerin impair placental angiogenesis and enhance vascular resistance, aggravating placental hypoperfusion [ 70 ]. Likewise, visfatin, with its insulin-mimetic effect, activates pro-inflammatory pathways and oxidative stress in preeclampsia, worsening vascular and metabolic complications [ 71 ].

Conversely, omentin, a pro-vascular anti-inflammatory adipokine, is lowered significantly in preeclampsia. Omentin stimulates endothelial nitric oxide generation, enhancing vascular relaxation and countering oxidative stress. Its low levels in preeclampsia undermine such protective effects, enhancing vascular and metabolic impairment [ 59 ]. Therefore, the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory adipokines is disrupted, establishing a vicious cycle of progression for the disease.

Adipokines serve as central mediators of the metabolic and vascular pathways to preeclampsia. Their dysregulation and change in expression and activity mirror the placental hypoxia, systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress underlying the disease. The elucidation of molecular mechanisms of adipokine dysregulation provides important insights into preeclampsia pathogenesis and indicates their potential role as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for early detection and management of this multifaceted pregnancy complication [ 14 ].

## Placental expression of adipokines in preeclampsia



## Placental production and secretion of adipokines

Adipokines, produced mainly by adipose tissue, also come from the placenta when a female is pregnant, and they have a central role in fetal–maternal interaction. During preeclampsia, a multifaceted disorder involving systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, placental expression of adipokines is heavily disturbed. Not only do these molecular alterations influence maternal physiology, but they also point to the placenta as the prime source of dysregulated adipokines that perpetuate the disease [ 63 ].

Adiponectin, with its anti-inflammatory and vasoprotective actions, exhibits reduced expression in the placenta in preeclampsia. Hypoxic and inflammatory stimuli inhibit the placental secretion of adiponectin, which is important for vascular integrity and the regulation of maternal metabolism. Reduced expression of adiponectin results in decreased activation of AMPK and decreased production of nitric oxide, impairing endothelial function and enhancing oxidative stress [ 72 ].

Resistin and chemerin, largely pro-inflammatory adipokines, are also increased in the placenta during preeclampsia. Resistin, by activating TLR4, increases placental cytokine release and inflammatory signaling, further compromising vascular function. Likewise, chemerin, released from syncytiotrophoblasts, regulates placental vascular remodeling [ 73 ]. Increased chemerin levels disrupt angiogenesis and placental perfusion, leading to hypoxia and disease pathology. The function of visfatin and omentin in placental function also identifies the duality of adipokine action in preeclampsia [ 74 ]. Although engaged in insulin-mimetic functions, Visfatin is a pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory cytokine-releasing when overexpressed, exacerbating vascular inflammation.

In contrast, omentin, generally anti-inflammatory and vasoprotective, is suppressed in preeclampsia, diminishing its protective effects on placental and maternal vascular function [ 71 ]. The placenta is a critical regulator of adipokine release, and abrogated expression in preeclampsia is central to disease pathogenesis. Disruption of the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory adipokines at the placental interface promotes systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and impaired vasculature. Insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the resulting changes is informative regarding preeclampsia pathogenesis and identifies targets for treatment [ 75 ].

## Changes in adipokine expression in preeclamptic pregnancies vs. normal pregnancies

Adipokines, bioactive peptides released by the adipose tissue and the placenta, maintain maternal metabolism, vascular health, and immune regulation during pregnancy. During normal pregnancy, adipokine expression is precisely controlled to facilitate mother–fetus interaction and respond to the physiological needs of gestation [ 22 ]. In contrast, in preeclampsia—a pregnancy disorder with hypertension, proteinuria, and generalized inflammation—the expression of critical adipokines is profoundly disrupted. These alterations represent a fundamental disturbance in placental function and maternal metabolic homeostasis, playing a role in the pathogenesis of the disease [ 76 ].

Leptin, an adipokine with metabolic and inflammatory roles, is highly elevated in preeclamptic pregnancies compared with normal pregnancies. In the normal situation, Leptin stimulates placental angiogenesis and trophoblast invasion, which are critical to fetal development [ 63 ]. Placental hypoxia upregulates leptin expression through HIF-1α in preeclampsia. High leptin levels stimulate pro-inflammatory signaling mechanisms like JAK/STAT and MAPK, boosting cytokine release and inhibiting endothelial function. The mechanisms involve systemic inflammation, increased vascular resistance, and defective placental perfusion during preeclamptic pregnancy [ 63 ].

Adiponectin, with its anti-inflammatory and vasoprotective nature, is downregulated in preeclamptic pregnancy. Adiponectin would typically augment endothelial function by stimulating AMPK and increasing nitric oxide synthesis, improving vascular relaxation. Its reduced levels in preeclampsia are associated with heightened oxidative stress, lower insulin sensitivity, and endothelial dysfunction [ 77 ]. Placental mechanisms involving higher inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia-induced signaling are responsible for blunting the expression of adiponectin, which further contributes to vascular and metabolic derangements [ 78 ].

Resistin and chemerin, pro-inflammatory adipokines, are significantly elevated in preeclamptic pregnancies relative to normal pregnancies. High levels of resistin levels TLR4 signaling, enhancing inflammation and endothelial activation [ 73 ]. Likewise, enhanced chemerin expression in preeclampsia inhibits placental angiogenesis and contributes to vascular dysfunction by influencing recruitment and inflammatory pathways. These alterations highlight pro-inflammatory adipokines’ contribution to preeclampsia's inflammatory status [ 76 ].

Conversely, omentin, an adipokine with anti-inflammatory and endothelial-protective activity, is decreased in preeclamptic pregnancies. Omentin maintains vascular integrity during normal pregnancies by promoting endothelial nitric oxide production and suppressing oxidative stress [ 79 ]. Downregulation of omentin in preeclampsia jeopardizes these protective roles, which exacerbates endothelial dysfunction and systemic inflammation. This alteration in adipokine expression toward a pro-inflammatory profile indicates the role of adipokines in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia [ 35 ].

The differential expression of adipokines in preeclamptic versus normal pregnancies highlights their pivotal role in disease development. Increased expression of pro-inflammatory adipokines and decreased anti-inflammatory adipokines represent an imbalance that fuels systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular dysfunction [ 22 ]. These results increase our knowledge about the molecular basis of preeclampsia and highlight potential targets for therapeutic intervention and biomarkers for early diagnosis.

## Role of the placenta in the dysregulation of adipokine levels

The placenta has a pivotal role in modulating adipokines during pregnancy as both source and regulator of these bioactive molecules. Under normal pregnancy, the placenta ensures a well-balanced profile of adipokines to promote maternal–fetal interactions, modulate immune function, and regulate vascular tone [ 80 ]. However, in preeclampsia, a disorder with systemic inflammation and placental dysfunction, this equilibrium is lost, triggering the dysregulation of essential adipokines. The molecular alterations in the placenta, sparked by hypoxia and oxidative stress, play a central role in shifting the secretion and activity of adipokines toward disease pathology [ 81 ].

One of the most highly researched adipokines, leptin, is highly overexpressed in the placenta during preeclampsia. Leptin under normal conditions facilitates placental angiogenesis and trophoblast invasion through signaling pathways like JAK/STAT [ 82 ]. During preeclampsia, placental hypoxia stimulates excessive production of leptin by activating HIF-1α. High levels of leptin predispose to an inflammatory status by amplifying the cytokine secretion, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, dysregulating vascular function, and worsening maternal hypertension [ 83 ].

In opposition, adiponectin, which is synthesized in lower levels by the placenta than adipose tissue, is downregulated in preeclampsia. This anti-inflammatory adipokine normally safeguards vascular integrity by activating AMPK and inducing nitric oxide production [ 84 ]. Placental oxidative stress and inflammatory signals, like increased TNF-α, inhibit adiponectin expression in preeclampsia, impairing its protective mechanisms on endothelial function. The subsequent leptin and adiponectin imbalance aggravates vascular dysregulation and overall inflammation [ 85 ].

Pro-inflammatory adipokines such as resistin and chemerin have enhanced placental expression in preeclampsia. Resistin stimulates TLR4 and NF-κB pathways in the placenta, promoting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and exacerbating endothelial dysfunction [ 86 ]. Likewise, via its receptor ChemR23, chemerin disrupts placental vascular remodeling and angiogenesis, further decreasing placental perfusion. They point out the inflammatory adipokine-producing role of the placenta in enhancing the systemic effects of preeclampsia [ 87 ].

The adipokine dysregulation at the placental level emphasizes the organ’s pivotal position in preeclampsia pathophysiology. Placental hypoxia, oxidative stress, and inflammation generate a feedback loop that breaks normal adipokine signaling, leading to systemic inflammation and vascular complications [ 88 ]. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms behind these changes gives valuable insights into the development of preeclampsia and identifies potential therapeutic targets to re-establish adipokine balance and enhance maternal and fetal outcomes.

Table 2 comprehensively describes important adipokines implicated in preeclampsia pathophysiology, emphasizing their functions during normal pregnancy, their molecular actions, and changes seen in preeclampsia. Leptin, adiponectin, resistin, chemerin, visfatin, and omentin are vital modulators of vascular function, inflammation, and metabolic regulation [ 73 ]. In preeclampsia, dysregulation of these adipokines—marked by increased levels of pro-inflammatory adipokines and decreased expression of anti-inflammatory adipokines—amplifies systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and metabolic derangements, ultimately leading to the clinical features of the disease. This table highlights the role of adipokines in preeclampsia pathogenesis and identifies potential therapeutic targets for enhancing maternal and fetal outcomes [ 89 ].

## Adipose tissue and its contribution to preeclampsia



## Role of adipose tissue in adipokine production and secretion

Adipose tissue is critical in controlling metabolic processes and vascular homeostasis during pregnancy. It serves as an energy reservoir and an endocrine organ that produces a range of bioactive molecules called adipokines [ 94 ]. These adipokines, such as leptin, adiponectin, resistin, visfatin, chemerin, and omentin, influence maternal metabolism, immune response, and vascular function. During pregnancy, the activities and levels of these adipokines change dynamically to accommodate the growing fetus and adjust to the rising metabolic needs [ 73 ]. In diseases like preeclampsia, a complication with hypertension, proteinuria, and multi-organ involvement, adipokine production and secretion from adipose tissue are dysregulated, playing a role in the pathophysiology of the disease.

Adipose tissue is responsible for adipokine production and secretion under the influence of a sophisticated interplay among hormonal, nutritional, and immune stimuli. Under normal circumstances, the maternal and placental adipose tissue act in harmony to ensure an equilibrium in adipokine secretion [ 95 ]. Leptin, which is secreted mainly by adipose tissue, is one of the most researched adipokines during pregnancy. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of energy balance, appetite, and metabolism. During pregnancy, leptin levels increase to support maternal weight gain and supply energy to the fetus [ 96 ]. Leptin also aids in placental angiogenesis and trophoblast invasion, which are fundamental for optimal placental function and fetal development. In preeclampsia, however, the expression of leptin tends to be highly augmented in adipose tissue and placenta, at least to some extent, resulting from placental hypoxia, stimulating its release through HIF-1α [ 36 ].

Dysregulation of leptin in preeclampsia has very significant consequences regarding vascular health. Elevated leptin levels stimulate pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as the JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways, which enhance the release of inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-α [ 97 ]. These cytokines further lead to endothelial dysfunction, placental perfusion impairment, and augmented maternal vascular resistance. Elevation of leptin is also linked with the development of insulin resistance, a characteristic feature of preeclampsia, by deranging insulin signaling pathways and enhancing metabolic derangement. Moreover, overproduction of leptin causes sodium and fluid retention and increases blood pressure further in preeclamptic women [ 98 ].

Unlike leptin, adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory and vasoprotective adipokine, is generally reduced in preeclampsia. Adipocytes primarily secrete adiponectin and have a beneficial action on vascular health and endothelial function. Adiponectin stimulates vasodilation by stimulating AMPK and augmenting nitric oxide synthesis [ 23 ]. Placental hypoxia and inflammation in preeclampsia downregulate the expression of adiponectin, which enhances impaired vascular function and oxidative stress. The decrease in adiponectin also further worsens endothelial dysfunction, the core pathophysiology of preeclampsia. In addition, the decrease in adiponectin in preeclampsia also comes with insulin resistance, further worsening glucose metabolism in patients [ 99 ].

Another crucial adipokine involved in preeclampsia is resistin, whose level is very high in preeclampsia. Resistin, which is secreted by adipose tissue and the placenta, is a pro-inflammatory molecule involved in insulin resistance [ 100 ]. In preeclampsia, increased resistin levels trigger pro-inflammatory pathways, especially via TLR4, releasing other cytokines and worsening systemic inflammation. This inflammation compromises endothelial function and is responsible for the heightened vascular resistance seen in preeclampsia. Increased resistin also has metabolic consequences, as it exacerbates insulin resistance, a characteristic of preeclampsia. Moreover, resistin’s action to increase oxidative stress further impairs endothelial function, worsening the hypertensive condition in preeclampsia [ 101 ].

Another adipokine with pro-inflammatory roles that is increased in preeclampsia is chemerin. Chemerin is secreted by adipose tissue and the placenta, and inflammatory stimuli upregulate its production. In preeclampsia, chemerin plays a role in immune cell recruitment and induction of angiogenesis. Yet, in preeclampsia, the pro-inflammatory actions of this adipokine supersede its positive influence on vascular remodeling [ 74 ]. Chemerin activates its receptor ChemR23 on immune cells, which promotes the release of other pro-inflammatory cytokines and further exacerbates endothelial dysfunction and placental insufficiency. Therefore, chemerin dysregulation in preeclampsia plays a part in the total inflammatory condition and vascular abnormalities characteristic of the illness [ 1 ].

Finally, omentin, a lesser-studied adipokine, has a protective effect on endothelial function. It increases nitric oxide production and minimizes oxidative stress, optimizing vascular health. In preeclampsia, however, omentin levels are lower, leading to endothelial dysfunction. The decline in omentin also worsens the inflammatory condition and boosts oxidative stress within the maternal vasculature, leading to hypertension and vascular resistance in preeclampsia. Omentin loss can also be attributed to overall adipokine production imbalance, because it is normally downregulated during inflammatory cytokines in preeclampsia [ 102 ].

Adipose tissue is essential in adipokine regulation in pregnancy, and its dysregulation is responsible for preeclampsia development. Disbalance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory adipokines, such as leptin, adiponectin, resistin, chemerin, and omentin, generates systemic inflammation, endothelial damage, and metabolic disturbances [ 103 ]. These molecular alterations are part of the pathophysiology of preeclampsia, pointing to adipose tissue and secreted adipokines as valuable targets for possible therapeutic strategies that can enhance maternal and fetal outcomes in the disease. Elucidation of the intricate interaction between adipokines and preeclampsia will yield useful information on the molecular processes that underlie the disease and guide future studies and treatment modalities.

## Altered adipose tissue gene expression in preeclampsia

In preeclampsia, the pathophysiology of the disease is significantly influenced by the changed adipose tissue gene expression, leading to the dysregulation of numerous metabolic and vascular processes. Adipose tissue, an endocrine organ, releases different bioactive molecules known as adipokines, affecting metabolic, inflammatory, and vascular functions [ 104 ]. During normal pregnancy, adipose tissue alters gene expression to accommodate the developing fetus, modulate metabolism, and ensure vascular integrity. Yet, in preeclampsia, the adipose tissue gene expression pattern is significantly changed, leading to a disequilibrium between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators.

Upregulation of genes related to inflammation and insulin resistance is one of the significant alterations seen in preeclampsia. For example, genes that cause the production of pro-inflammatory adipokines like leptin, resistin, and chemerin are overexpressed, but genes that make anti-inflammatory adipokines such as adiponectin are reduced [ 16 ]. This changed expression results in the over-release of inflammatory cytokines, which might stimulate endothelial dysfunction, increase vascular resistance, and lead to hypertension in preeclampsia. The upregulated pro-inflammatory adipokines also enhance immune cell recruitment and systemic inflammatory response.

In addition, the molecular pathways of such gene expression alterations are frequently regulated by inflammatory signals, hypoxia, and oxidative stress typical of preeclamptic states. Hypoxia is especially pivotal in the dysregulated adipose tissue gene expression through activation of HIFs that enhance the release of some adipokines such as leptin. This dysregulated adipokine expression interferes with normal placental growth and function, impairing trophoblast invasion and angiogenesis, leading to compromised placental perfusion and fetal growth restriction [ 32 ]. The disturbed gene expression in adipose tissue also worsens systemic metabolic derangements, such as insulin resistance, further complicating the clinical picture of preeclampsia.

Dysregulated gene expression in adipose tissue is a key component of preeclampsia, with significant consequences for disease development. Disruption of adipokine secretion, which is prompted by altered gene expression, accounts for the inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and metabolic derangement noted in preeclamptic patients [ 105 ]. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes in gene expression provides valuable insights into the pathophysiology of preeclampsia and potentially identifies new therapeutic targets to enhance maternal and fetal outcomes in affected patients.

Table 3 summarizes the changes in adipokine gene expression seen in preeclampsia versus normal pregnancy and their underlying molecular mechanisms. The disruption of the balance between pro-inflammatory adipokines (leptin, resistin, chemerin, and visfatin) and anti-inflammatory adipokines (adiponectin and omentin) is key to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia (Table 3 ). These molecular alterations are responsible for systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and metabolic dysregulation, which are the main contributing factors to the clinical presentation of preeclampsia. The changed adipokine profile emphasizes the role of adipose tissue in the pathogenesis of the disease and points to possible therapeutic targets for enhancing maternal and fetal health outcomes. Table 3 Adipokine gene expression and its role in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia Adipokine Gene expression in normal pregnancy Gene expression in preeclampsia Molecular mechanism Role in preeclampsia pathogenesis References Leptin Upregulated in response to increased fat stores Elevated due to hypoxia-induced HIF activation Hypoxia-induced activation of HIF-1α promotes leptin gene expression. Also regulates angiogenesis and vascular tone Contributes to systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and insulin resistance [ 106 ] Adiponectin Increased, regulates metabolism and vascular health Reduced due to placental inflammation and hypoxia Suppressed by inflammatory cytokines, hypoxia, and oxidative stress. Promotes endothelial function via AMPK and nitric oxide Decreased levels exacerbate endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress, worsening hypertension [ 93 ] Resistin Low in healthy pregnancy, linked to metabolic processes Elevated due to inflammation and insulin resistance Induces pro-inflammatory cytokines via TLR4 signaling, increasing oxidative stress and inflammation Promotes inflammation and worsens insulin resistance, contributing to hypertension and metabolic dysfunction [ 107 ] Chemerin Low levels in normal pregnancy Elevated in response to inflammation and immune activation Activates ChemR23 on immune cells, promoting inflammation and vascular remodeling Contributes to immune cell recruitment, endothelial dysfunction, and placental insufficiency [ 108 ] Visfatin Typically low, but increases in metabolic stress Elevated due to inflammation and placental dysfunction Involved in NAD + biosynthesis and inflammatory response through NF-kB signaling Amplifies inflammation, insulin resistance, and endothelial dysfunction in preeclampsia [ 50 ] Omentin Upregulated in healthy pregnancy for an anti-inflammatory role Decreased in preeclampsia due to inflammatory signals Acts on endothelial cells to enhance nitric oxide production, reducing oxidative stress Reduced levels worsen endothelial dysfunction and increase oxidative stress, contributing to hypertension [ 109 ]

## Interaction between adipose tissue and the placenta in the context of preeclampsia

Adipose tissue interaction with the placenta is of significant importance in the development of preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related condition associated with hypertension, proteinuria, and endothelial dysfunction. Adipose tissue, by releasing adipokines, controls maternal metabolic processes and placental functions [ 110 ]. Under normal pregnancy, adipose tissue changes are directed to sustain enhanced metabolic demands and promote fetal growth. These alterations involve the modification of the secretion of different adipokines, e.g., leptin, adiponectin, and resistin, which act on the placenta to ensure normal placental blood supply and fetal development.

In preeclampsia, though, the adipokine balance is deranged. There are increased levels of pro-inflammatory adipokines like leptin, resistin, and chemerin, while protective adipokines like adiponectin and omentin are decreased [ 111 ]. The placenta, reacting to this disturbed adipokine profile, becomes less effective in maintaining vascular tone and angiogenesis. This leads to inadequate placental perfusion, placental hypoxia, and resultant endothelial dysfunction. In addition, the adipokine secretion imbalance can worsen maternal insulin resistance, another hallmark of preeclampsia, further complicating metabolic control and contributing to systemic inflammation in individuals affected [ 38 ].

Adipose tissue may also modulate placental gene expression, with adipokines exerting effects on placental cells to modulate different signaling pathways. For example, leptin, which is increased in preeclampsia, influences trophoblast function and placental angiogenesis. The overproduction of leptin due to placental hypoxia triggers pathways like HIF-1α, which in turn promote the production of leptin. This feedback system reinforces the consequences of placental insufficiency [ 112 ]. Furthermore, dysregulation of adiponectin, a defensive adipokine, interferes with endothelial nitric oxide generation and facilitates oxidative stress, further compromising placental function.

The relationship between adipose tissue and placenta is key to the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. Adipokines secreted by adipose tissue affect maternal and placental well-being, and any changes in their expression can contribute to vascular dysfunctions, inflammation, and insulin resistance. This interaction's molecular mechanisms are enlightening, and it can help us appreciate the intricate aspects of preeclampsia and improve the management and prevention of this potentially life-threatening condition [ 113 ].

## Adipokines as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in preeclampsia



## Evaluation of adipokines in maternal plasma as potential biomarkers

Adipokines, a family of bioactive molecules released by fat tissue, have received significant interest in the research on preeclampsia, because they play a part in the regulation of metabolic and vascular processes. These adipokines, including leptin, adiponectin, resistin, chemerin, visfatin, and omentin, are involved in preeclampsia pathophysiology, affecting maternal inflammation, insulin resistance, and endothelial dysfunction [ 22 ]. Since they are implicated in these processes, adipokines are also being investigated as possible diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of preeclampsia. Measurement of maternal plasma adipokine levels may assist in identifying women at risk of developing preeclampsia earlier in pregnancy, when there is a chance for early intervention and management [ 114 ].

Leptin, a ubiquitous pro-inflammatory adipokine, is often increased in preeclampsia in women. In addition to playing a central role in appetite and energy homeostasis, leptin also contributes to inflammation and vascular tone. Elevated leptin levels correlate with endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, and hypertension, characteristic of preeclampsia [ 12 ]. Leptin has therefore been suggested as an early biomarker for the detection of preeclampsia. Research has indicated that high plasma leptin levels are able to foretell the onset of preeclampsia and thus become a potential clinical monitor.

On the other hand, anti-inflammatory adipokine adiponectin is usually lower in women with preeclampsia. Adiponectin protects the vasculature by maintaining endothelial function and lessening oxidative stress. The low plasma concentration of adiponectin in preeclampsia is one reason for disturbed vascular function and increased hypertension. On this account, low levels of adiponectin may become an early biomarker of preeclampsia that describes the modified vasculature milieu typical of the disorder. Adiponectin monitoring has the potential to provide information regarding the severity of endothelial dysfunction and predict disease progression [ 115 ].

Resistin, another adipokine involved in preeclampsia, is linked to systemic inflammation and insulin resistance. Increased plasma levels of resistin are associated with higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can promote the inflammatory response and endothelial injury in preeclampsia. Resistant is therefore a possible biomarker for determining individuals at risk of preeclampsia, especially those who present signs of metabolic disorder or insulin resistance during early pregnancy [ 35 ].

Chemerin, an adipokine involved in immune responses and inflammation, is also a promising biomarker of preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is associated with elevation in chemerin levels, and the adipokine’s potential role in the recruitment of immune cells and endothelial dysfunction indicates the possibility that the adipokine plays a causative role in the development of vascular derangement in the disorder. Increased levels of plasma chemerin might therefore be a pointer to the inflammation processes driving the disorder [ 51 ].

Finally, omentin, a pro-inflammatory adipokine with insulin-sensitizing properties, is decreased in preeclampsia. Its decreased levels play a role in the inflammatory condition and endothelial dysfunction witnessed in the disorder. Therefore, omentin can have potential as a prognostic marker to determine the progression of disease and to recognize women at risk for developing complicated forms of preeclampsia, including preterm delivery or fetal growth restriction [ 116 ].

Assessment of adipokines in maternal plasma provides a promising line of investigation into the early detection, diagnosis, and prognosis of preeclampsia. The unique patterns of adipokine changes noted in preeclampsia propose that a panel of these biomarkers might be utilized together to enhance the prediction of disease onset and severity [ 13 ]. Additional investigation into the molecular pathways underlying adipokine dysregulation in preeclampsia will offer further perspectives into the promise of adipokines as valid clinical biomarkers. It could revolutionize the monitoring and management of preeclampsia in pregnant women.

Table 4 summarizes major adipokines that play a role in preeclampsia pathophysiology, including their molecular pathways, function in the disease, and utility as biomarkers. Adipokines like leptin, adiponectin, and resistin are modified in preeclampsia and play a role in endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and insulin resistance. Its monitoring in maternal plasma may reveal interesting information about preeclampsia risk and development, and might also introduce non-invasive diagnostic and predictive tests to improve management of this syndrome. Table 4 Evaluation of adipokines in maternal plasma as potential biomarkers for Preeclampsia Adipokine Molecular mechanism Role in preeclampsia pathophysiology Potential as a biomarker References Leptin Regulates appetite and energy balance; activates pro-inflammatory pathways via JAK–STAT signaling and MAPK Elevated in preeclampsia, contributing to endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, and hypertension Elevated leptin levels can predict preeclampsia onset, useful for early detection [ 117 ] Adiponectin Enhances endothelial function via AMPK activation and nitric oxide production; anti-inflammatory decrease in preeclampsia, leading to vascular dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and hypertension Low adiponectin levels indicate endothelial dysfunction, a potential marker for preeclampsia risk [ 118 ] Resistin Increases pro-inflammatory cytokine production via TLR4; induces insulin resistance Elevated levels promote inflammation, endothelial damage, and insulin resistance, which exacerbate preeclampsia Increased resistin levels correlate with inflammatory markers, making it a potential diagnostic tool [ 119 ] Chemerin Activates immune cells through ChemR23 receptor; involved in inflammation and immune regulation Elevated in preeclampsia, promoting immune cell recruitment and exacerbating vascular dysfunction Increased chemerin levels are linked to immune activation and endothelial dysfunction, offering diagnostic value [ 120 ] Visfatin NAD + biosynthesis; promotes inflammation through NF-kB signaling Elevated in preeclampsia, contributing to oxidative stress and metabolic dysfunction Elevated visfatin levels may correlate with systemic inflammation and poor pregnancy outcomes [ 71 ] Omentin Improves insulin sensitivity; anti-inflammatory via nitric oxide production in endothelial cells Decreased in preeclampsia, contributing to increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction Low omentin levels suggest poor vascular health and may predict adverse outcomes in preeclampsia [ 121 ]

## Predictive value of adipokines for the onset and severity of preeclampsia

The adipokines’ predictive potential in the development and severity of preeclampsia has received greater interest as these molecules have been implicated in controlling vascular function, inflammation, and insulin sensitivity in pregnancy. Among the adipokines like leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and chemerin, potential biomarkers have been demonstrated to identify women at risk for the development of preeclampsia. The early recognition of high-risk subjects enables close follow-up and prompt intervention, possibly enhancing fetal and maternal outcomes. The potential to predict preeclampsia with adipokine levels may be a non-invasive solution to the conventional clinical risk factors, which might not be possible to use in identifying the disorder at an early stage.

Leptin has become one of the most researched adipokines in the prediction of preeclampsia. Leptin levels have been linked with the onset of hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, both of which are central characteristics of preeclampsia. Research has shown that higher leptin levels in early pregnancy can be used to predict the development of preeclampsia in high-risk patients. The predictive value of leptin is particularly significant when used in conjunction with other markers, such as placental growth factor (PlGF) and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), which are also involved in preeclampsia. Thus, a panel of biomarkers, including leptin, may improve the precision of early prediction and aid in identifying women at risk of developing severe preeclampsia.

Conversely, adiponectin has also been found to play a protective function in the vascular system, with decreased levels of adiponectin being associated with an elevated risk of preeclampsia. Its vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory effects mean that decreased levels of adiponectin might lead to endothelial dysfunction and reduced placental perfusion observed in preeclampsia. Observing adiponectin levels during pregnancy, particularly in patients with risk factors like obesity or gestational diabetes, might provide predictive significance to determine the degree and development of the disease. Low adiponectin in early pregnancy would suggest that it predicts high preeclampsia, providing an ideal early marker.

Resistin and chemerin, both pro-inflammatory adipokines, are also being considered as potential biomarkers for preeclampsia prediction. High levels of resistin have been linked with higher systemic inflammation and insulin resistance, which are significant elements of preeclampsia. Likewise, chemerin’s involvement in immune cell recruitment and inflammation implies that high levels may predict the inflammatory and endothelial dysfunction typical of preeclampsia. The combination of these adipokines with other clinical markers like blood pressure and proteinuria may offer a more complete risk assessment for preeclampsia, allowing prediction not only of its onset but also of its severity.

The prognostic potential of adipokines for the occurrence and severity of preeclampsia exists in their capability to mirror the underlying pathophysiologic processes of the condition, including inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and metabolic derangement. Although solitary adipokines, such as leptin and adiponectin, provide valuable insights, the utilization of an adipokine biomarker panel, combined with other clinical and molecular markers, may enhance predictive accuracy for preeclampsia. Early detection of high-risk pregnancies, along with proper monitoring and early interventions, may decrease the load on both infant and mother.

## Studies and clinical trials evaluating adipokines as biomarkers for early detection

Various studies and clinical trials have assessed the potential of adipokines to serve as biomarkers for the early detection of preeclampsia, hoping to detect at-risk women during early pregnancy. One of the most critical studies on adipokines in preeclampsia has studied leptin, adiponectin, and resistin levels in maternal plasma. Scientists have discovered that high levels of leptin during early pregnancy and low levels of adiponectin can be used to predict the development of preeclampsia in women at risk. The discovery indicates that adipokines may be used as early predictors, enabling closer surveillance of vulnerable pregnancies and earlier interventions. Clinical trials conducted in this field have confirmed the promise of these adipokines, especially when combined with other biomarkers like PlGF and sFlt-1.

Several clinical trials have tested the potential use of leptin as a preeclampsia predictive biomarker. Increased levels of serum leptin in the second trimester were, in one trial, correlated with the occurrence of preeclampsia, especially among women with prior risk factors such as obesity. This implies that leptin may be a useful early predictor of preeclampsia, allowing identification of women who might need closer monitoring or early intervention. Furthermore, the combination of leptin with other predictive markers, including uterine artery Doppler studies, has been investigated in clinical trials to enhance the predictive accuracy of preeclampsia.

Adiponectin, a traditionally viewed anti-inflammatory and protective adipokine, has also been tested in other studies to determine whether it could be used to detect early preeclampsia. Reduced levels of adiponectin during early pregnancy have been reported in several studies to have an increased risk of developing preeclampsia during later stages of pregnancy. Clinical trials investigating the use of adiponectin levels in combination with other clinical variables have shown that adiponectin can offer predictive utility, especially in women with metabolic risk factors, such as obesity or gestational diabetes. Consequently, adiponectin has been thought to be a potential biomarker for predicting women at risk for developing severe preeclampsia.

The function of resistin and other inflammatory adipokines, such as chemerin, has also been investigated in clinical trials assessing preeclampsia biomarkers. Resistin levels are linked with systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, two hallmarks of preeclampsia. In clinical trials, elevated resistin levels have been correlated with both the early onset and severity of preeclampsia. Likewise, chemerin studies have established that elevated levels of plasma for this adipokine have been shown to indicate inflammatory reactions and might serve as a marker for recognizing women who are at high risk for preeclampsia. These adipokines have been proposed with other biomarkers as a stronger early detection and surveillance method.

Various clinical trials and studies have shown promising evidence supporting the possibility of adipokines as biomarkers for the early identification of preeclampsia. Adipokines, such as leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and chemerin, provide insightful information regarding the metabolic and inflammatory processes of the disease. In combination with other clinical markers, these adipokines have the potential to enhance the predictive accuracy of preeclampsia, enabling earlier intervention and improved management of high-risk pregnancies. However, additional studies and larger clinical trials are required to confirm these biomarkers and to establish their clinical value in standard prenatal care. Table 5 is a tabulation of the results of current research and clinical trials on the predictive value of adipokines for preeclampsia. It underscores their role in inflammatory and metabolic pathways and their value as sole markers or components of multi-marker diagnostic panels. These studies reinforce the value of incorporating adipokine monitoring within standard prenatal care for early risk detection.

## Gene expression regulation in preeclampsia



## Changes in gene expression related to adipokine signaling pathways in preeclampsia

Preeclampsia is a multifactorial disorder marked by altered gene expression, particularly in adipokine signaling pathways. Adipokines, secreted by adipose tissue, play essential roles in metabolic balance, vascular function, and inflammation. In preeclampsia, the expression of adipokine genes, their receptors, and downstream signaling components is significantly disrupted, contributing to disease progression. These molecular changes occur in both maternal and placental tissues, underscoring their role in driving the systemic features of preeclampsia [ 29 ]. Adiponectin, encoded by the ADIPOQ gene, exhibits reduced expression in preeclampsia, contrasting with leptin’s upregulation. It activates AMPK and PPAR-α pathways, providing anti-inflammatory and vasoprotective effects [ 130 ]. Downregulation of ADIPOQ impairs AMPK signaling, increasing oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and lipid imbalance. Additionally, reduced placental expression of its receptors, ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2, further diminishes adiponectin’s protective function. This dysregulation underscores its critical role in mitigating metabolic and vascular abnormalities in preeclampsia [ 131 ].

Resistin, encoded by the RETN gene, shows elevated expression in preeclamptic maternal and placental tissues. This increase is linked to higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, indicating its role in promoting systemic inflammation [ 73 ]. Resistin activates NF-κB and MAPK pathways, enhancing pro-inflammatory signaling and contributing to endothelial dysfunction. Its overexpression in preeclampsia highlights its role in amplifying immune responses and vascular damage [ 38 ].

Chemerin, encoded by the RARRES2 gene, plays a key role in immune cell recruitment and angiogenesis. In preeclampsia, RARRES2 is overexpressed, elevating chemerin levels in placental and systemic circulation [ 40 ]. By binding to the CMKLR1 receptor, chemerin promotes immune infiltration and vascular remodeling. Its dysregulation enhances inflammation and impairs placental development, linking chemerin to the progression and severity of preeclampsia [ 40 ].

Recent studies highlight lesser-known adipokines like visfatin and omentin in preeclampsia. Visfatin, encoded by the NAMPT gene, is overexpressed and contributes to NAD⁺ biosynthesis, oxidative stress regulation, and insulin sensitivity. Elevated NAMPT expression heightens oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, worsening metabolic imbalances [ 73 ]. Conversely, omentin, coded by the ITLN1 gene, is downregulated in preeclampsia, reducing its anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory effects and exacerbating disease severity [ 132 ].

Adipokine gene dysregulation in preeclampsia is influenced by epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA activity. Hypermethylation of ADIPOQ and ITLN1 promoters in preeclamptic placentas correlates with reduced gene expression. Additionally, microRNAs like miR-21 and miR-222, which target leptin and adiponectin pathways, are differentially expressed and modulate mRNA stability and translation in preeclampsia [ 133 ]. Molecular-level dysregulation of adipokine signaling underscores their central role in preeclampsia pathogenesis. Altered expression and signaling of leptin, adiponectin, resistin, chemerin, and others contribute to the syndrome’s metabolic, inflammatory, and vascular disturbances. Investigating these pathways provides a foundation for developing targeted diagnostics and therapies, including precise modulation of adipokine signaling to mitigate adverse outcomes [ 73 ].

Table 6 outlines the molecular dysregulation of adipokines in preeclampsia, focusing on gene expression, signaling pathways, and functional impact. Leptin, encoded by the LEP gene, is consistently upregulated, activating the JAK/STAT pathway. This disrupts angiogenesis and heightens systemic inflammation by altering VEGF and sFlt-1 levels. Additionally, miR-222 regulation of LEP expression highlights the role of epigenetics in amplifying leptin-driven pathology in preeclampsia [ 134 ].

In contrast, adiponectin—a protective adipokine encoded by ADIPOQ —is markedly downregulated in preeclampsia, suppressing AMPK and PPAR-α signaling. This reduction intensifies oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. Epigenetic factors, such as ADIPOQ promoter hypermethylation and miR-21-mediated receptor targeting, contribute to its suppression. The interplay of adiponectin with resistin, chemerin, visfatin, and omentin underscores the complex molecular dysfunctions driving inflammation, metabolic imbalance, and vascular injury in preeclampsia [ 135 ].

Epigenetic regulators like microRNAs and DNA methylation further clarify adipokine dysregulation in preeclampsia. Upregulation of resistin (RETN) and chemerin (RARRES2) activates NF-κB and MAPK pathways, driving inflammation, endothelial injury, and immune responses [ 136 ]. In contrast, reduced expression of omentin (ITLN1) and its vasodilatory function reflects the loss of vascular protective mechanisms. These findings highlight the molecular basis of preeclampsia and reinforce the potential of adipokines as diagnostic and therapeutic targets [ 137 ].

## Regulatory mechanisms (epigenetic changes, inflammation, and oxidative stress)

The modulation of adipokines in preeclampsia is governed by complex mechanisms that include epigenetic regulation, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and microRNA-dependent regulation, are central in regulating adipokine gene expression [ 147 ]. For example, promoter hypermethylation of ADIPOQ is a characteristic that is usually linked to reduced adiponectin levels, inhibiting its anti-inflammatory and vasoprotective functions. In the same way, NAMPT (visfatin) promoter hypomethylation results in its overexpression, increasing oxidative stress and metabolic imbalance. MicroRNAs, such as miR-21 and miR-222, also fine-tune adipokine expression by acting on specific receptors and signaling pathways, leading to the adipokine imbalance seen in preeclampsia [ 148 ].

Inflammation is also a characteristic feature of preeclampsia and directly affects adipokine physiology. Leptin and resistin, overexpressed during preeclampsia, stimulate pro-inflammatory signaling cascades like JAK/STAT, NF-κB, and MAPK, resulting in upregulated cytokine production, including IL-6 and TNF-α. This overactive inflammatory status worsens endothelial dysfunction, a key attribute of preeclampsia [ 75 ].

Adiponectin, usually anti-inflammatory in action via AMPK and PPAR-α induction, is greatly diminished in preeclampsia, thus leaving inflammation unchecked. Chemerin also plays a role in immune cell invasion and angiogenesis by affecting the CMKLR1 receptor, and contributes to abnormal placental vascular development [ 149 ].

Oxidative stress also contributes equally to adipokine dysregulation in preeclampsia. Increased oxidative stress indicators, fueled by mitochondrial impairment and diminished antioxidant defenses, combine with adipokine pathways to exacerbate vascular and metabolic disruptions. Leptin's overexpression increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), at the same time, accumulating oxidative damage. At the same time, adiponectin's downregulation eliminates a primary regulator of oxidative stress and exacerbates further vascular dysfunction [ 150 ]. Visfatin, via its action in NAD+ biosynthesis, is increased, connecting oxidative stress with metabolic derangement. This reciprocal interaction between adipokines and oxidative stress maintains a cycle of vascular damage and systemic inflammation [ 151 ].

The crosstalk between these processes underscores the intricacy of regulatory networks in preeclampsia. Epigenetic changes tend to be upstream events, providing the groundwork for abnormal adipokine expression. Subsequently, these alterations induce inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways, leading to a feedback mechanism that worsens the disease phenotype [ 152 ]. This awareness of these interactions at the molecular level highlights the promise of epigenetic regulators, inflammatory mediators, and oxidative stress pathway targeting to reconstitute adipokine homeostasis and enhance clinical outcomes in preeclampsia.

Advances in molecular technologies, such as high-throughput sequencing and CRISPR-based editing, provide promising opportunities to further differentiate these regulatory mechanisms. These technologies could not only clarify the specific function of adipokines but also provide new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in the management of preeclampsia.

## Conclusion and future directions

This study highlights the central role of adipokine dysregulation in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, particularly through mechanisms involving inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. By integrating placental and adipose tissue gene expression profiles, we propose that adipokines, such as leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and chemerin, reflect disease progression and serve as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in preeclamptic pregnancies. The findings contribute meaningfully to the future of personalized obstetric care, where adipokine profiling could support early risk stratification, improve monitoring of disease severity, and guide timely intervention strategies. Moreover, therapeutic modulation of adipokine signaling pathways (e.g., AMPK, NF-κB, and HIF-1α) may offer novel avenues for preventing or alleviating preeclamptic complications.

However, several limitations remain. Most available data are correlational and derived from observational or cross-sectional studies. Mechanistic insights involving mitochondrial signaling need further exploration in experimental models and longitudinal human cohorts. Additionally, the translational applicability of adipokine-targeted therapies requires rigorous clinical validation.

### Semantic Scholar Abstract

Preeclampsia is a complex hypertensive disorder of pregnancy characterized by systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and placental insufficiency, contributing significantly to maternal and fetal morbidity. Recent evidence underscores the role of adipokines—bioactive molecules secreted by adipose tissue and the placenta—in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. This review explores the dysregulated expression and function of key adipokines, such as leptin, adiponectin, resistin, chemerin, visfatin, and omentin in preeclamptic pregnancies. Pro-inflammatory adipokines (leptin, resistin, chemerin, and visfatin) are consistently upregulated, amplifying inflammatory signaling (e.g., JAK/STAT, TLR4/NF-κB) and promoting endothelial dysfunction. Conversely, anti-inflammatory adipokines (adiponectin and omentin) are markedly downregulated, weakening vasoprotective and metabolic regulatory pathways. These alterations are closely linked to gene expression changes in placental and adipose tissues under hypoxic and inflammatory conditions, forming a feed-forward loop of vascular injury. Furthermore, adipokines are emerging as promising biomarkers for early diagnosis and risk stratification in preeclampsia, with clinical studies correlating their plasma levels to disease onset and severity. Therapeutic modulation of adipokine signaling pathways offers a novel approach to restoring metabolic-vascular homeostasis in high-risk pregnancies. By integrating current molecular insights, this review provides a comprehensive framework for understanding adipokine-mediated mechanisms in preeclampsia and highlights their potential in improving prediction, prevention, and management strategies.
