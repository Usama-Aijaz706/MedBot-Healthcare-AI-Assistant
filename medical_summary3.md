## 📌 Executive Summary
At the Children's Hospital of Buenos Aires, the cohort of such procedures started in July, when the first fenestrated right heart by pass was performed, with the interposition of a homograft between the right atrial appendage and the main pulmonary artery. In the second patient, instead of placing a homograft, the APA was achieved with the patient's own pulmonary root harvested from the outflow tract of the right ventricle. Since the very beginning the principle was that the right atrium only functions as a pathway rather than a pump (reason why no inferior vena cava valves were ever used), and the diastolic properties of the systemic ventricle regulate the only real "pump" of this system. In spite of the improvement in prognosis and quality of life that the modern techniques have brought for univentricular hearts (UH), with the passing of time, deterioration of this system is frequently seen, due to chronic low cardiac output, elevated central venous pressure making heart transplantation the final stage of treatment. Cross sectional quantitative analysis using data from six 2004/05 PCT performance indicators for 303 English Primary Care Trusts from four sources in the public domain: Star Rating, aggregated Quality and Outcomes Framework scores, Dr Foster mortality index, Dr Foster equity index (heart by-pass and hip replacements), NHS Litigation Authority Risk Management standards and Patient Satisfaction scores from the Star Ratings. Forty three patients had partial by-pass: 29 had a bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis with additional pulmonary flow (systemic-pulmonary anastomosis and/or restrictive anterograde ventricular flow); 10 had a partial ventricular correction (bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis and non restrictive anterograde ventricular flow; two had classical Glenn procedures; two had Kawashima operations (bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis and non restrictive anterograde ventricular flow; two had classical Glenn procedures; two had kawashima operations (bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis with inferior vena cava interruption), and 11 with total by-pass (10 atriopulmonary anastomosis and 1 with total cavopulmonary anastomosis). In Group I (control), the aorta was cross-clamped for 2 hours without shunting; in Group II (passive), a temporary shunt was placed between the left common carotid and left femoral arteries during cross-clamping; and in Group III (active), left heart by-pass, matching flow to that in group II, was performed.

### 1. Reflections on five decades of the fontan kreutzer procedure.
**Authors:** Christián Kreutzer, Jacqueline Kreutzer, Guillermo O Kreutzer

**Abstract:** The first successful total right heart bypass via atriopulmonary anastomosis (APA) were reported in 1971 for patients with tricuspid atresia. At the Children's Hospital of Buenos Aires, the cohort of such procedures started in July, when the first fenestrated right heart by pass was performed, with the interposition of a homograft between the right atrial appendage and the main pulmonary artery. In the second patient, instead of placing a homograft, the APA was achieved with the patient's own pulmonary root harvested from the outflow tract of the right ventricle. These techniques were soon replaced in 1978 with the development of the direct valveless posterior APA. Since the very beginning the principle was that the right atrium only functions as a pathway rather than a pump (reason why no inferior vena cava valves were ever used), and the diastolic properties of the systemic ventricle regulate the only real "pump" of this system. The late hemodynamic problems inherent of the APA diminished with modern surgical techniques like the lateral tunnel (LT) or the extracardiac conduit (EC). In spite of the improvement in prognosis and quality of life that the modern techniques have brought for univentricular hearts (UH), with the passing of time, deterioration of this system is frequently seen, due to chronic low cardiac output, elevated central venous pressure making heart transplantation the final stage of treatment. Progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistances and ventricular dysfunction result in a decline in quality of life and survival. However, the timing of this occurrence is variable, and many survivors enjoy today a satisfactory clinical status. The challenge is to develop a better solution for UH, but in the mean time the Fontan Kreutzer palliation represents the best and only surgical option. It is undoubtedly one of the triumphs of cardiac surgery in congenital heart disease.

### 2. A case of orbital apex syndrome due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.
**Authors:** Takeshi Kusunoki, Kaori Kase, Katsuhisa Ikeda

**Abstract:** Orbital apex syndrome is commonly been thought to have a poor prognosis. Many cases of this syndrome have been reported to be caused by paranasal sinus mycosis. We encountered a very rare case (60-year-old woman) of sinusitis with orbital apex syndrome due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. She had received insulin and dialysis for diabtes and diabetic nephropathy, moreover anticoagulants after heart by-pass surgery. She underwent endoscopic sinus operation and was treated with antibiotics, but her loss of left vision did not improve. Recently, sinusitis cases due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported to be a increasing. Therefore, we should consider the possibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as mycosis as infections of the sinus, especially inpatients who are immunocompromised body.

### 3. Cross sectional study of performance indicators for English Primary Care Trusts: testing construct validity and identifying explanatory variables.
**Authors:** Celia Brown, Richard Lilford

**Abstract:** The performance of Primary Care Trusts in England is assessed and published using a number of different performance indicators. Our study has two broad purposes. Firstly, to find out whether pairs of indicators that purport to measure similar aspects of quality are correlated (as would be expected if they are both valid measures of the same construct). Secondly, we wanted to find out whether broad (global) indicators correlated with any particular features of Primary Care Trusts, such as expenditure per capita. Cross sectional quantitative analysis using data from six 2004/05 PCT performance indicators for 303 English Primary Care Trusts from four sources in the public domain: Star Rating, aggregated Quality and Outcomes Framework scores, Dr Foster mortality index, Dr Foster equity index (heart by-pass and hip replacements), NHS Litigation Authority Risk Management standards and Patient Satisfaction scores from the Star Ratings. Forward stepwise multiple regression analysis to determine the effect of Primary Care Trust characteristics on performance. Star Rating and Quality and Outcomes Framework total, both summary measures of global quality, were not correlated with each other (F = 0.66, p = 0.57). There were however positive correlations between Quality and Outcomes Framework total and patient satisfaction (r = 0.61, p < 0.001) and between screening/'additional services' indicators on the Star Ratings and Quality and Outcomes Framework (F = 24, p < 0.001). There was no correlation between different measures of access to services. Likewise we found no relationship between either Star Rating or Litigation Authority Standards and hospital mortality (F = 0.61, p = 0.61; F = 0.31, p = 0.73). Performance assessment in healthcare remains on the Government's agenda, with new core and developmental standards set to replace the Star Ratings in 2006. Yet the results of this analysis provide little evidence that the current indicators have sufficient construct validity to measure the underlying concept of quality, except when the specific area of screening is considered.

### 4. [Evaluation of the complications of different types of right ventricular bypass by contrast echocardiography].
**Authors:** E A Kreutzer, H Vázquez, G Narkizian, M I Roman, M I Sicurello, A H Quilindro, A Schlichter, M Grippo, G O Kreutzer

**Abstract:** We evaluated 54 patients with different right heart by-pass by means of contrast echocardiography with rapid venous injection of shaken saline (3 cc, < 20 k; 6cc, > 20 k), in order to detect venous collateral circulation in partial by-pass, pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae in partial and total by-pass, and right-to-left shunt in total by-pass. Forty three patients had partial by-pass: 29 had a bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis with additional pulmonary flow (systemic-pulmonary anastomosis and/or restrictive anterograde ventricular flow); 10 had a partial ventricular correction (bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis and non restrictive anterograde ventricular flow; two had classical Glenn procedures; two had Kawashima operations (bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis and non restrictive anterograde ventricular flow; two had classical Glenn procedures; two had kawashima operations (bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis with inferior vena cava interruption), and 11 with total by-pass (10 atriopulmonary anastomosis and 1 with total cavopulmonary anastomosis). The age ranged from 2.5 to 33 years (x = 12.2 years), and the mean postoperative period was 4.3 years. Venous collateral circulation: 32/43 patients (74%) with partial by-pass, specially in those without partial biventricular correction: 29/33 patients (88%) compared to those with partial biventricular correction: 3/10 (30%) p < 0.01. Pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae: 6/43 patients (14%) with partial by-pass; 6/33 (18%) with partial biventricular correction, 0/10 patients with partial biventricular correction, and 0/11 with total by-pass. Right-to-left shunt: 2/11 patients (18%) with total by-pass, all of them with atriopulmonary anastomosis. Contrast echocardiography is an excellent noninvasive method for the initial evaluation of specific dysfunctions of different right heart by-pass. We emphasize the higher frequency of collateral venous circulation in cavopulmonary anastomosis, that would explain the dysfunction with progressive hypoxia in the evolution of these patients. Pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae were detected only in partial by-pass, without partial biventricular correction (p < 0.01). The minor frequency of these fistulae in bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis would be due to additional pulmonary flow.

### 5. Comparison studies of passive and active shunting during cross-clamping of the descending thoracic aorta.
**Authors:** G Liu, K Orihashi, H Shikata, H Murakami, S Fukunaga, T Sueda, Y Matsuura

**Abstract:** The effects of passive (no pump) and active (using centrifugal pump) shunting on hemodynamics and metabolisms during cross-clamping of the descending thoracic aorta were compared in mongrel dogs. In Group I (control), the aorta was cross-clamped for 2 hours without shunting; in Group II (passive), a temporary shunt was placed between the left common carotid and left femoral arteries during cross-clamping; and in Group III (active), left heart by-pass, matching flow to that in group II, was performed. Hemodynamic and metabolic parameters were recorded prior to cross-clamping and following every 30 min for 4 hours. All animals in Group I suffered from hemodynamic instability, metabolic abnormal and neurologic injury and died within 12 hours. Hemodynamic changes were unstable in Group III than II, and three dogs in Group III, but none in Group II, suffered from neurologic injury. Metabolic changes between Group II and III were not significant. We conclude that passive shunting is superior to active shunting for aortic by-pass.

### 6. [Left heart by-pass in case of ventricular fibrillation (author's transl)].
**Authors:** C M Nuyens, G den Otter

**Abstract:** The authors have studied in 11 mongrel dogs the hemodynamic conditions created by a transarterial closed chest left by-pass (TaCLVB) in ventricular fibrillation. The attention was focussed on the function of the right atrium. This function is recorded with closed chest by means of a catheter in the external jugular vein. The experiments show a left heart by-pass can function only if there are good contractions in the right atrium. The right atrium insures pulmonary circulation during ventricular fibrillation. This well continue for 30 to 60 minutes by means of the TaCLVB then the right atrium will fail and fibrillate. The animals died of right heart failure.

### 7. Pressure-flow relationships in the peripheral circulation of the dog with practolol.
**Authors:** J F Green, J D Moore, E S Attix, R Zelis

**Abstract:** 1. The influence of practolol (a proposed beta1-adrenoreceptor antagonist) upon the pressure-flow relationships in the peripheral circulation was studied in eight anaesthetized dogs during right heart by-pass procedures. 2. Practool (1 mg/kg) produced a significant increase in the resistance to venous return which resulted in a significant fall in venous return. 3. There was no significant change in arterial resistance. 4. This study suggests that practolol should not be classified as an exclusive cardioselective beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist.
