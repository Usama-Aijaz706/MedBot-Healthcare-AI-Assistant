## ðŸ“Œ Executive Summary
Probiotics may achieve more treatment success when compared with placebo at the end of the treatment, with 50% success in the probiotic group versus 33% success in the placebo group (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.36; 554 participants; 6 studies; I The results from this review demonstrate that probiotics and synbiotics may be more efficacious than placebo in achieving treatment success, but the evidence is of low certainty. Treatment success for all children was assessed in the study at age 18 months; as an ad hoc analysis in the included study, results were presented separately for children with unilateral and bilateral NLDO (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.28 and RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.06, respectively; very low-certainty evidence).In the other small study (26 eyes of 22 children), more eyes that received immediate probing were cured within one month after surgery compared with eyes that were randomized to deferred probing and analyzed at age 15 months (RR 2.56, 95% CI 1.16 to 5.64). The findings showed that cultural appropriateness was assessed using expert evaluations on the relevance and sensitivity of the tool to Thai cultural norms and practices, with the rate of appropriateness at the highest level (Mean = 4.97, SD = 0.71), and translation equivalence was also rated highly (Mean = 4.76, SD = 0.27). However, the control group always received usual care.All studies had methodological limitations, such as small numbers of participants, unclear randomization methods, and single-blind study designs in case of one RCT and all results were of moderate to very low quality (GRADE).Cardiorespiratory fitness was evaluated by the 9-minute run-walk test, timed up-and-down stairs test, the timed up-and-go time test, and the 20-m shuttle run test. Only the back and leg strength combination score showed statistically significant differences on the muscle strength end-score between the intervention and control group (SMD 1.41; 95% CI 0.71 to 2.11).Apart from one sub-scale of the cancer scale (Worries; P value = 0.03), none of the health-related quality of life scales showed a significant difference between both study groups on the end-score. We judged the evidence for these outcomes to be of low quality due to an unclear risk of bias, imprecision, and significant heterogeneity.We found only one study of low FODMAP diets and only one trial of fructose-restricted diets, meaning no pooled analyses were possible.We were unable to perform any meta-analyses for the secondary outcomes of school performance, social or psychological functioning, or quality of daily life, as not enough studies included these outcomes or used comparable measures to assess them.With the exception of one study, all studies reported monitoring children for adverse events; no major adverse events were reported. We excluded 74 patients whose initial SRE was in the spine and in whom the subsequent SRE occurred in the extremities and 37 patients whose initial SRE was in the extremities and the subsequent SRE was in the spine.

### 1. Donor-Derived Cell-Free DNA as a Marker for the Efficacy of Daratumumab in Patients With Antibody-Mediated Rejection Post-Heart Transplantation: A Case Series.
**Authors:** Anusha Konduri, Kathryn E Flynn, Ashley Huebschman, Bronwyn Crandall, Natalie Sinicropi, Bethany Giacobbe, Mary Zamberlan, Matthew Najor, Matthew Cusick, Heang M Lim, Amanda D McCormick, Kurt R Schumacher, David M Peng

**Abstract:** Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) remains a significant complication following heart transplantation, contributing to graft dysfunction and reduced survival. Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) is emerging as a non-invasive biomarker for detecting and monitoring graft injury, correlating with episodes of rejection and response to treatment. Daratumumab, an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody targeting plasma cells, has shown promise in treating AMR. We present a case series of pediatric and young adult heart transplant recipients demonstrating donor-derived cell-free DNA's potential utility in monitoring for AMR and the effect of therapies including daratumumab. We report five cases showing that elevated dd-cfDNA correlated with pathological AMR (pAMR), and treatment with daratumumab improved both pAMR and dd-cfDNA levels. Most of our patients had persistently elevated donor-specific antibody (DSA) as observed by MFI values; however, there was a reduction in DSA titer that corresponded with improvement in pAMR and dd-cfDNA levels. Recurrent increases in dd-cfDNA were also useful in guiding the need for repeat treatment with daratumumab. Although DSA levels often remained elevated despite histologic improvement, decreasing dd-cfDNA levels correlated more closely with the resolution of AMR. In this case series of pediatric and young adult heart transplant recipients, our findings suggest that dd-cfDNA can serve as a valuable biomarker for diagnosing AMR and treatment response, which are not often reflected by DSA MFI alone. Our dd-cfDNA data supports the efficacy of daratumumab in treating AMR and may guide the need for ongoing treatment. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and establish guidance for the use of daratumumab and dd-cfDNA in this patient population.

### 3. Nonischemic Cardiomyopathy in Adult-Onset PPA2-Deficient Mitochondrial Disease.
**Authors:** Emilie ThÃ©berge, Jillianne Code, John K Khoo, Chi Lai, Andrew Ignaszewski, Sean Virani, Mustafa Toma, Thomas M Roston, Tara Sedlak, Anna Lehman

**Abstract:** Nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) can be caused by single-gene mutations, including genes such as inorganic pyrophosphatase 2 (PPA2) with multisystem effects. A 28-year-old woman presenting with respiratory symptoms was discharged with a diagnosis of decompensated idiopathic NICM. Her NICM progressively worsened, and the patient underwent a heart transplant at the age of 38 and again at the age of 42. At age 47, genetic testing confirmed 2 mutations in the PPA2 gene that had caused her NICM. This patient is to our knowledge the oldest published to date (48 years) presenting with cardiac symptoms who has PPA2 deficiency, a mitochondrial disease characterized by sudden cardiac death in infancy. This case exemplifies the utility of employing genetic testing early in the diagnostic workup of NICM before applying the designation "idiopathic."

### 4. Cytomegalovirus Encephalitis in a Heart Transplant Recipient Presenting With Behavioral Changes and Functional Neurologic Deficits.
**Authors:** Rahi P Patel, Ashley Seymour, Steven Brady, Rami Kahwash

**Abstract:** Cytomegalovirus (CMV) encephalitis is a rare but serious complication in immunocompromised patients, particularly transplant recipients as they are heavily immunosuppressed. We report the first documented case to our knowledge of CMV encephalitis in a 67-year-old male heart transplant recipient, confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction. The patient presented with confusion and distinct behavioral changes, yet brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed no acute abnormalities. This case highlights the potential for CMV encephalitis to present with significant neurologic symptoms without any radiologic abnormalities, emphasizing the importance of molecular diagnostics in immunocompromised patients with unexplained neurologic deterioration. CMV encephalitis in transplant recipients can present with significant neurologic symptoms despite normal brain magnetic resonance imaging, necessitating cerebrospinal fluid analysis for timely diagnosis and management. Close monitoring of CMV viremia and neurologic status is critical, as clinical improvement may lag behind virologic clearance, necessitating individualized treatment strategies.

### 5. ABO-incompatible heart transplants in children aged 2-9 years: a new paradigm in transplant?
**Authors:** Paolo Hollis, Richard Issitt, Sebastiano A G Lava, Craig Laurence, Jacob Simmonds, Matthew Fenton, Nagarajan Muthialu, Alex Robertson, Richard Crook, Lori West, Michael Burch

**Abstract:** Paediatric heart transplantation remains hampered by the limited availability of donor organs. The introduction of ABO-incompatible (ABOi) heart transplantation for infants in the early 2000s expanded the donor pool for individual candidates. Nonetheless, concerns remain about ABOi heart transplantation in children aged over 2 years and it has not been routinely adopted. At our centre we have considered candidates aged 2-9 years for ABOi donors if isohaemagglutinin titres were 1:32 or less. We report the outcomes of those who received an ABOi heart transplant. Furthermore, as all transplant-listed children in this age group were tested for isohaemagglutinins, the potential for ABOi transplant was investigated. Data were retrospectively analysed from all paediatric heart transplants undertaken at our centre between 1st January 2013 and 1st June 2023. Primary outcome measures were anti-A and/or anti-B titres at listing and whether an ABOi transplant was performed. Secondary outcome measures were survival and incidence of rejection. 62 children 2 to 9 years of age (median age 5.1 years) underwent heart transplantation during the study period. One patient was blood group AB; of the remaining 61 patients, 51 had anti-A and/or anti-B titres measured whilst listed for transplant. Of these, 44 (86%) had isohaemagglutinin titres of 1:32 or less at the time of listing, and this dropped to 40 (78%) by the time of transplant. Over the study period, 14 children (age range 2.5-8.9 years, median 4.3 years) underwent ABOi transplant; all 14 patients were well at follow-up with median follow-up time of 4.9 years, range 1.7 to 8.9 years. Our data suggests that ABOi heart transplantation is a safe and effective option for older children, at least to 9 years of age. Furthermore, we have shown that the great majority of young children have isohaemagglutinin titres in the range that ABOi transplant could be considered. These findings may have a substantial impact on donor availability worldwide. Further work is needed to see if the age range can be extended further.

### 6. Predictors and Outcomes for Severe Primary Graft Dysfunction in Heart Transplantation: United States Cohort Analysis.
**Authors:** Peter D Cho, Hedwig Zappacosta, Joseph Song, John P White, Stephanie McKay, Donatello Telesca, Malini Daniel, Abbas Ardehali

**Abstract:** Severe Primary Graft Dysfunction (PGD) is the leading cause of early mortality in heart transplantation, yet national incidence, risk factors, and outcomes remain poorly characterized. This study aims to assess predictors and outcomes of severe PGD in a contemporary United States cohort. The United Network for Organ Sharing database was retrospectively reviewed for isolated adult heart transplant recipients (9/2023-3/2025). The population was stratified into severe PGD (left or bi-ventricular dysfunction within 24 hours following transplantation that requires mechanical circulatory support (MCS)) and Control cohorts (all other recipients). Predictors of severe PGD were identified using multivariable logistic regression. The severe PGD cohort was further classified into Transient severe Primary Graft Dysfunction (TPGD, MCS off by 72 hours) vs. Persistent severe Primary Graft Dysfunction (PPGD, remained on MCS at 72 hours). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare 3-month survival between groups. During the study interval, 5,097 heart transplant recipients were identified in the US, with 6.6% (n=338) developing severe PGD. Predictors for severe PGD included pre-transplant extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 2.55, p<0.001), hearts from donation after circulatory death (AOR: 2.13, p<0.001), donor acidemia prior to procurement (AOR: 2.01, p<0.001), recipient history of sternotomy (AOR: 1.83, p<0.001), and increased donor heart ischemic time (AOR: 1.18 per hour, p<0.001). The severe PGD group experienced lower 3-month survival than the Control group (74.4% vs 96.8%, p<0.001). Among severe PGD cases, 36.7% (n=124) experienced TPGD. Recipients with TPGD had a higher 3-month survival than those with PPGD (88.0% vs 67.2%, p<0.001). Severe PGD following heart transplantation is associated with high early mortality. A substantial proportion of severe PGD cases demonstrate early graft recovery. Consideration of risk factors in donor and recipient matching may mitigate the incidence of severe PGD.

### 7. Impact of Evolocumab on Coronary Physiology and Microstructure in De-Novo Heart Transplant Recipients.
**Authors:** Salma Raghad Karim, Niels MÃ¸ller Jensen, Emil Nielsen Holck, Tor Skibsted Clemmesen, Evald HÃ¸j Christiansen, Lars Jakobsen, Zhi Chen, Milan Sonka, Kristjan Karason, Kaspar Broch, Ole Geir Solberg, Hans EiskjÃ¦r

**Abstract:** Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), characterized by arterial intima thickening and microvascular dysfunction, compromises survival after heart transplantation. We aimed to investigate the impact of evolocumab on invasive coronary physiology and microstructure after de-novo transplantation. In the EVOLVD trial (NCT03734211), the effect of 12 months of evolocumab versus placebo on maximal coronary intimal thickness was assessed using intra-coronary ultrasound. For this sub-study, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR), Coronary Flow Reserve (CFR), Microvascular Resistance Reserve (MRR), and Index of Microcirculatory Resistance (IMR) were performed at baseline (4 to 8 weeks post-transplant) and at 12 months post-transplant. This sub-study included 75 de novo heart transplant recipients, randomized to placebo (n=36) or evolocumab (n=39). Over 12 months, no between-group differences were observed in the changes in coronary physiology (FFR: Î” 0.001 [IQR-0.03 to 0.02], p=0.42; CFR: Î” 0.59 [IQR -1.33 to 1.90], p=0.69; IMR: Î” 0.76 [IQR -6.86 to 8.32], p=0.09; MRR: Î” 0.19 [IQR -1.85 to 2.60], p=0.70) or coronary microstructure (lumen area: Î” -1.37 mmÂ² [IQR -3.53 to 0.09], p=0.38; intima area: Î” 0.05 mmÂ² [IQR 0.02 to 0.17], p=0.88. No significant within-group changes in FFR, CFR, or IMR were observed. Among all included patients, OCT showed a decrease in lumen area of -1.37 [IQR -3.53 to -0.69] mmÂ² (p<0.01) and an increase in intima area of 0.04 [IQR 0.01 to 0.17] mmÂ² (p<0.01) from baseline to follow-up. Treatment with evolocumab did not affect coronary physiology or OCT measurements 12 months after de novo heart transplantation. OCT revealed progressive intimal proliferation and luminal narrowing in both groups. Coronary physiology remained unchanged from baseline to follow-up and did not differ between treatment groups.

### 8. Cardiomyopathy as indication for pediatric heart transplantation.
**Authors:** Alireza Raissadati, Drishti Tolani, Elizabeth L Profita

**Abstract:** Pediatric cardiomyopathy (CMP), with an incidence of approximately 1 in 100,000 children, remains a critical clinical challenge. Often progressive, these myocardial disorders frequently culminate in end-stage heart failure, establishing CMP as the primary indication for pediatric heart transplantation. Key considerations for transplantation include specific CMP etiologies and subtypes alongside established listing criteria and strategies to navigate waitlist complexities. The evolving role of mechanical circulatory support, especially ventricular assist devices (VADs), has transformed bridging strategies and significantly improved survival to transplant. Contemporary post-transplant outcomes demonstrate continued improvement, with advancements in survival rates and ongoing refinement of essential long-term management strategies. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of pediatric CMP as it progresses to end-stage heart failure requiring transplantation. It synthesizes current knowledge on etiologies, clinical presentations, transplant evaluation, the transformative impact of VADs, and contemporary post-transplant management, aiming to equip clinicians with an updated framework for complex decision-making and optimizing outcomes in this high-risk population.

### 9. Donor Time to Death and Kidney Transplant Outcomes in the Setting of a 3-Hour Minimum Wait Policy.
**Authors:** Samuel J Tingle, Nicholas D H Chung, Abdullah K Malik, Georgios Kourounis, Emily Thompson, Emily K Glover, Jennifer Mehew, Jennifer Philip, Dale Gardiner, Gavin J Pettigrew, Chris Callaghan, Neil S Sheerin, Colin H Wilson

**Abstract:** Lengthening waiting lists for organ transplant mandates the development of strategies to expand the deceased donor pool. Due to concerns regarding organ viability, most organ donation organizations internationally wait no longer than 1 to 2 hours for potential donation after circulatory death (DCD), possibly underutilizing an important organ source; UK policy mandates a minimum 3-hour wait time. To assess whether time to death (TTD) from withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment (WLST) is associated with kidney transplant outcomes. This population-based cohort study used data from the prospectively maintained UK Transplant Registry from all 23 UK kidney transplant centers from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2021; follow-up was until the date of data extraction (October 2023). Participants comprised 7183 adult recipients of DCD kidney-alone transplants. Duration of TTD, defined as time from WLST to donor mechanical asystole. Primary outcome was 12-month estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; for the main eGFR model, variables with significant right skew [histogram visual assessment] were analyzed on the log2 scale), with secondary outcomes of delayed graft function and graft survival (censored at death or 5 years). This study included 7183 kidney transplant recipients (median age, 56 years [IQR, 47-64 years]; 4666 men [65.0%]). Median donor age was 55 years (IQR, 44-63 years). Median TTD was 15 minutes (range, 0-407 minutes), with 885 kidneys transplanted from donors with TTD over 1 hour and 303 kidneys transplanted from donors with TTD over 2 hours. Donor TTD was not associated with recipient 12-month eGFR on adjusted linear regression (change per doubling of TTD, -0.25; 95% CI, -0.68 to 0.19; Pâ€‰=â€‰.27), nor with delayed graft function (adjusted odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.97-1.06; Pâ€‰=â€‰.65) or graft survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.95-1.07; Pâ€‰=â€‰.92). These findings were confirmed with restricted cubic spline models (assessing nonlinear associations) and tests of interaction (including normothermic regional perfusion). In contrast, donor asystolic time, cold ischemic time, and reperfusion time were independently associated with outcomes. Compared with a theoretical 1-hour maximum wait time, the UK policy (minimum 3-hour wait time) has been associated with 885 extra DCD transplants compared with 6298 transplants (14.1% increase). In this cohort study of DCD kidney recipients, donor TTD was not associated with posttransplant outcomes, in contrast to subsequent ischemic times. Altering international transplant practice to mandate minimum 3-hour donor wait times could substantially increase numbers of kidney transplants performed without prejudicing outcomes.

### 10. Are There Differences in Performance Among Femoral Stem Brands Utilized in Cementless Hemiarthroplasty for Treatment of Geriatric Femoral Neck Fractures?
**Authors:** Ishan Shah, Heather A Prentice, Kanu Okike, Ronald A Navarro, Brian H Fasig, Elizabeth W Paxton, Christopher D Grimsrud

**Abstract:** For the vast majority of displaced femoral neck fractures in older patients, cemented femoral fixation is indicated because it is associated with a lower risk of periprosthetic fracture than cementless fixation. Nevertheless, cementless fixation continues to be utilized with high frequency for hip fractures in the United States. It is therefore helpful to understand the performance of individual cementless brands and models. Although prior studies have compared femoral stems by design type or stem geometry, there may still be a difference in revision risk according to femoral stem brand given the potential differences within design groupings with regard to manufacturing, implantation systems, and implant design nuances among vendors. (1) Is there a difference in aseptic revision risk among femoral stem brands in patients â‰¥ 60 years of age who have displaced femoral neck fractures treated with cementless hemiarthroplasty? (2) Is there a difference in revision for periprosthetic fracture among femoral stem brands in patients â‰¥ 60 years of age with displaced femoral neck fractures treated with cementless hemiarthroplasty? A retrospective, comparative, large-database cohort study was conducted using data from Kaiser Permanente's Hip Fracture Registry. This integrated healthcare system covers more than 12 million members throughout eight regions in the United States; membership has been found to be representative of the general population in the areas served. The Hip Fracture Registry collects details on all patients who undergo hip fracture repair within the organization. These patients are then longitudinally monitored for outcomes after their repair, and all identified outcomes are manually validated through chart review. Patients ages â‰¥ 60 years who underwent unilateral hemiarthroplasty treatment of a displaced femoral neck fracture from 2009 to 2021 were identified (n = 22,248). Hemiarthroplasties for polytrauma, pathologic or open fractures, or patients who had additional surgeries at other body sites during the same stay, as well as those with prior procedures in the same hip, were excluded (21.4% [4768]). Cemented procedures and those with missing or inconsistent implant information (for example, cement used but cementless implant recorded) were further excluded (47.1% [10,485]). To allow for enough events for evaluation, the study sample was restricted to seven stems for which there were at least 300 hemiarthroplasties performed, including four models from DePuy Synthes (CorailÂ®, SummitÂ®, Summit Basic, and Tri-LockÂ®) and three from Zimmer Biomet (Medial-Lateral [M/L] TaperÂ®, Trabecular MetalÂ®, and VersysÂ® Low Demand Fracture [LD/FX]). The final sample included 5676 cementless hemiarthroplasties: 653 Corail, 402 M/L Taper, 1699 Summit, 1590 Summit Basic, 384 Tri-Lock, 637 Trabecular Metal, and 311 Versys LD/FX. Procedures were performed by 396 surgeons at 35 hospitals. The mean age and BMI for the cohort was 81 years and 24 kg/m 2 , respectively; most were women (66% [3733 of 5676]) and White (79% [4488 of 5676]). Based on standardized mean differences, we controlled for age, race/ethnicity, American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) classification, anesthesia technique, operative year, average annual surgeon hemiarthroplasty volume, and operative year across the seven stem groups. Of the 5676 patients, 7% (378 of 5676) were lost to follow-up through membership termination at a median time of 1.6 years, and 56% (3194 of 5676) of the patients died during study follow-up. A multivariable cause-specific Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate the risk for aseptic revision with adjustment for age, gender, ASA classification, depression, operating surgeon, deficiency anemias, time from admission to surgery, and average annual surgeon hemiarthroplasty volume. A random intercept was included to address effects from hemiarthroplasties performed by the same surgeon. Risk for revision for periprosthetic fracture was also evaluated as a secondary outcome. In the adjusted analysis, the Summit Basic (HR 1.91 [95% confidence interval 1.34 to 2.72]; p < 0.001), the M/L Taper (HR 1.91 [95% CI 1.15 to 3.15]; p = 0.01), and the Versys LD/FX (HR 2.12 [95% CI 1.25 to 3.61]; p = 0.005) had higher aseptic revision risks during follow-up when compared with the Summit. No differences were observed for the Corail (HR 0.57 [95% CI 0.29 to 1.10]; p = 0.09), the Tri-Lock (HR 1.13 [95% CI 0.62 to 2.07]; p = 0.68), or the Trabecular Metal (HR 1.14 [95% CI 0.69 to 1.89]; p = 0.61) compared with the Summit. A higher risk for revision because of periprosthetic fracture was observed with the M/L Taper (HR 2.43 [95% CI 1.29 to 4.58]; p = 0.006) and the Summit Basic (within 3 months of follow-up: HR 1.16 [95% CI 0.60 to 2.25]; p = 0.66; after 3 months of follow-up: HR 2.84 [95% CI 1.36 to 5.94]; p = 0.006) stems when compared with the Summit. In a cohort of 5676 cementless hemiarthroplasties, we found differences in revision risks among different femoral stem brands. Based on our findings, we recommend against utilization of the Zimmer M/L Taper, DePuy Summit Basic, and Zimmer Versys LD/FX in the treatment of displaced geriatric femoral neck fractures with cementless hemiarthroplasty. Future large registry studies are needed to further elucidate differences in aseptic revision risk among higher performing cementless femoral stems. Although cemented fixation remains the recommended approach based on the best available evidence in hemiarthroplasty treatment of hip fractures, our findings may help to mitigate aseptic revision risk should cementless fixation be chosen. Level III, therapeutic study.

### 11. Topical antibiotics with steroids for chronic suppurative otitis media.
**Authors:** Christopher G Brennan-Jones, Karen Head, Lee Yee Chong, Jessica Daw, Tamara VeselinoviÄ‡, Anne Gm Schilder, Mahmood F Bhutta

**Abstract:** Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity that is characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics aim to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or in addition to other CSOM treatments, such as steroids, antiseptics or ear cleaning ('aural toileting'). Antibiotics are commonly prescribed in combined preparations with steroids. This is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM. It is the first update of the original review published in 2020. This review aims to assess the effects of adding a topical steroid to topical antibiotics in the treatment of people with chronic suppurative otitis media. We searched the Cochrane ENT Specialised Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE and five other databases on 15 June 2022. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that involved participants (adults and children) with chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks, and participants had been followed up for at least one week. The intervention of interest was any combination of a topical antibiotic agent(s) and a topical corticosteroid (steroid) applied directly into the ear canal. We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at three time points (between one and two weeks, two weeks to four weeks and after four weeks); health-related quality of life; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each comparison and outcome. This update found two new studies, bringing the total number of included studies to 19. The 19 studies addressed 13 treatment comparisons. The studies included a total of at least 2044 participants (one study of 40 ears did not report the number of participants). No studies reported health-related quality of life. 1. Topical antibiotics with steroids versus placebo or no treatment Three studies (210 participants) compared a topical antibiotic-steroid to saline or no treatment. Results for resolution of discharge were not reported at one to two weeks. One study (50 participants) reported results at more than four weeks, but they reported results by ear rather than by person, and it was not possible to adjust them. One study (123 participants) noted minor side effects in 16% of participants in both groups. One study (123 participants) reported no change in bone-conduction hearing thresholds and reported no difference in tinnitus or balance problems between groups. One study (50 participants) reported serious complications, but it was not clear which group these participants were from. However, we had only very low certainty about all these findings. 2. Topical antibiotics with steroids versus topical antibiotics alone (same antibiotics) Four studies (475 participants) evaluated this comparison. There may be little to no difference in resolution of discharge between topical antibiotic-steroid combinations compared to topical antibiotics alone at one to two weeks, but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.21; 3 studies, 335 participants; very low certainty evidence). No results for resolution of discharge after four weeks were reported. One study reported one case of local itchiness in each group (very low certainty evidence). One study (135 participants) investigated hearing, and three studies (395 participants) investigated suspected ototoxicity (very low certainty evidence). One study reported that no serious complications occurred during the study (110 participants; very low certainty evidence). 3. Topical antibiotics with steroids versus topical antibiotics alone (different antibiotics) Ten studies (1056 participants plus 40 ears) evaluated this comparison. Resolution of discharge may be more likely with quinolone topical antibiotics alone at one to two weeks compared with non-quinolone topical antibiotics (aminoglycosides) with steroids (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.83; I We are uncertain about the effectiveness of topical antibiotics with steroids for improving the resolution of ear discharge in participants with CSOM because we have low to very low certainty about the evidence available. The lack of certainty about the evidence is mainly due to the high risk of bias in the studies, imprecision in the effect estimates and publication bias. We found no evidence that the addition of steroids to topical antibiotics affects the resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks, and no data were available for longer-term outcomes. There is low-certainty evidence that some types of topical antibiotics (without steroids) may be better than topical antibiotic-steroid combinations for improving resolution of discharge. There is uncertainty about the relative effectiveness of different types of antibiotics; it is not possible to determine whether quinolones are better, worse or the same as aminoglycosides. These two groups of compounds are believed to have different harmful effect profiles, but there is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make any comment about possible harms. In general, harmful effects were poorly reported. The evidence base is limited by the age of the studies, and lack of information relating to particular population groups or interventions.

### 12. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) and index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) relationship in patients with chronic or stabilized acute coronary syndromes.
**Authors:** Domenico Galante, Andrea VicerÃ©, Andrea Marrone, Filippo Maria Verardi, Vincenzo Viccaro, Chiara Giuliana, Ciro Pollio Benvenuto, Simona Todisco, Simone Biscaglia, Cristina Aurigemma, Enrico Romagnoli, Gennaro Capalbo, Carlo Trani, Francesco Burzotta, Filippo Crea, Gianluca Campo, Antonio Maria Leone

**Abstract:** To investigate the influence of index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) on fractional flow reserve (FFR) and adenosine-induced hyperemia (Î”Pd/Pa-FFR) in patients with chronic (CCS) or stabilized acute coronary syndromes (ACS), utilizing various IMR threshold values. Data were extracted from two ongoing Italian registries involving patients with CCS or stabilized ACS who underwent a #FullPhysiology approach [Pd/Pa, FFR, IMR, coronary flow reserve (CFR)] by bolus thermodilution technique in the left anterior descending artery. Correlations between IMR and both FFR and Î”Pd/Pa-FFR were analyzed both globally and within three IMR-defined groups: Group 1 (IMR <25), Group 2 (25Â â‰¤Â IMR <40), and Group 3 (IMR â‰¥40). A multiple linear regression was employed to adjust for confounding factors. Of 275 patients, 163 were in Group 1, 60 in Group 2, and 52 in Group 3. Globally, a weak but significant correlation was observed between IMR and both FFR (rÂ =Â 0.170, pÂ <Â 0.01) and Î”Pd/Pa-FFR (rÂ =Â -0.159, pÂ <Â 0.01). After stratification only patients in Group 3 exhibited a significant and more pronounced, though still weak, correlation between FFR and IMR (rÂ =Â 0.387, pÂ <Â 0.01) coupled with a reduction of Î”Pd/Pa-FFR as IMR values increased (rÂ =Â -0.411, pÂ <Â 0.01). After adjustment, a significant increase of 0.01 in FFR values was observed for every 14-unit rise in IMR (pÂ <Â 0.01) in Group 3. FFR appears particularly influenced by elevated IMR values (â‰¥40) highlighting the importance of the #FullPhysiology approach in understanding epicardial and microvascular contribution of myocardial ischemia.

### 13. Arabic version of the Palliative Care Self-Efficacy Scale: Translation, adaptation, and validation.
**Authors:** Dhuha Youssef Wazqar

**Abstract:** A lack of confidence among oncology nurses might be problematic when providing palliative care. No valid and reliable tool is currently available in Saudi Arabia to assess oncology nurses' confidence in providing palliative care. This study aims to explain the process of translation, adaptation, and validation of the Palliative Care Self-Efficacy Scale (PCSS) to support its use in the Saudi context. This was a methodological study of translation, cultural adaptation, and content validation of PCSS. The process of translation and adaptation was conducted according to the World Health Organization guidelines, including forward and backward translations, an expert panel review, and pretesting and cognitive interviewing, resulting in a final version. Two independent bilingual oncology nurses familiar with palliative care terminology translated the PCSS from English to Modern Standard Arabic. Next, the concise PCSS translation developed from the 2 translations was back-translated to English by 2 English-speaking translators and then compared to the original PCSS. The Arabic version PCSS was evaluated by Saudi professionals ( The relevance, clarity, and appropriateness of the first Arabic version PCSS were validated. It had a level of content validity index of 1.00 for all items after improvements were made based on the recommendations of experts and oncology nurses. The PCSS demonstrated face and content validity in the assessment of oncology nurses' confidence in providing palliative care. The PCSS is suitable for use in palliative cancer care units in Saudi Arabia to identify the educational needs of nurses to promote their confidence and improve the quality of care. Additional reliable and valid language versions of the PCSS allow for international and national comparisons, which may be useful for oncology nursing administrators or managers who are accountable for the quality of palliative care during the strategic health-care planning process in cancer services.

### 14. Quality improvement strategies for diabetes care:Â Effects on outcomes for adults living with diabetes.
**Authors:** Kristin J Konnyu, Sharlini Yogasingam, Johanie LÃ©pine, Katrina Sullivan, Mostafa Alabousi, Alun Edwards, Michael Hillmer, Sathya Karunananthan, John N Lavis, Stefanie Linklater, Braden J Manns, David Moher, Sameh Mortazhejri, Samir Nazarali, P Alison Paprica, Timothy Ramsay, Paul MacDaragh Ryan, Peter Sargious, Kaveh G Shojania, Sharon E Straus, Marcello Tonelli, Andrea Tricco, Brigitte Vachon, Catherine Hy Yu, Michael Zahradnik, Thomas A Trikalinos, Jeremy M Grimshaw, Noah Ivers

**Abstract:** There is a large body of evidence evaluating quality improvement (QI) programmes to improve care for adults living with diabetes. These programmes are often comprised of multiple QI strategies, which may be implemented in various combinations. Decision-makers planning to implement or evaluate a new QI programme, or both, need reliable evidence on the relative effectiveness of different QI strategies (individually and in combination) for different patient populations. To update existing systematic reviews of diabetes QI programmes and apply novel meta-analytical techniques to estimate the effectiveness of QI strategies (individually and in combination) on diabetes quality of care. We searched databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL) and trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) to 4 June 2019. We conducted a top-up search to 23 September 2021; we screened these search results and 42 studies meeting our eligibility criteria are available in the awaiting classification section. We included randomised trials that assessed a QI programme to improve care in outpatient settings for people living with diabetes. QI programmes needed to evaluate at least one system- or provider-targeted QI strategy alone or in combination with a patient-targeted strategy. - System-targeted: case management (CM); team changes (TC); electronic patient registry (EPR); facilitated relay of clinical information (FR); continuous quality improvement (CQI). - Provider-targeted: audit and feedback (AF); clinician education (CE); clinician reminders (CR); financial incentives (FI). - Patient-targeted: patient education (PE); promotion of self-management (PSM); patient reminders (PR). Patient-targeted QI strategies needed to occur with a minimum of one provider or system-targeted strategy. We dual-screened search results and abstracted data on study design, study population and QI strategies. We assessed the impact of the programmes on 13 measures of diabetes care, including: glycaemic control (e.g. mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)); cardiovascular risk factor management (e.g. mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), proportion of people living with diabetes that quit smoking or receiving cardiovascular medications); and screening/prevention of microvascular complications (e.g. proportion of patients receiving retinopathy or foot screening); and harms (e.g. proportion of patients experiencing adverse hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia). We modelled the association of each QI strategy with outcomes using a series of hierarchical multivariable meta-regression models in a Bayesian framework. The previous version of this review identified that different strategies were more or less effective depending on baseline levels of outcomes. To explore this further, we extended the main additive model for continuous outcomes (HbA1c, SBP and LDL-C) to include an interaction term between each strategy and average baseline risk for each study (baseline thresholds were based on a data-driven approach; we used the median of all baseline values reported in the trials). Based on model diagnostics, the baseline interaction models for HbA1c, SBP and LDL-C performed better than the main model and are therefore presented as the primary analyses for these outcomes. Based on the model results, we qualitatively ordered each QI strategy within three tiers (Top, Middle, Bottom) based on its magnitude of effect relative to the other QI strategies, where 'Top' indicates that the QI strategy was likely one of the most effective strategies for that specific outcome. Secondary analyses explored the sensitivity of results to choices in model specification and priors.Â  Additional information about the methods and results of the review are available as Appendices in an online repository. This review will be maintained as a living systematic review; we will update our syntheses as more data become available. We identified 553 trials (428 patient-randomised and 125 cluster-randomised trials), including a total of 412,161 participants. Of the included studies, 66% involved people living with type 2 diabetes only. Participants were 50% female and the median age of participants was 58.4 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 12.5 months. HbA1c was the commonest reported outcome; screening outcomes and outcomes related to cardiovascular medications, smoking and harms were reported infrequently. The most frequently evaluated QI strategies across all study arms were PE, PSM and CM, while the least frequently evaluated QI strategies included AF, FI and CQI. Our confidence in the evidence is limited due to a lack of information on how studies were conducted.Â  Four QI strategies (CM, TC, PE, PSM) were consistently identified as 'Top' across the majority of outcomes. All QI strategies were ranked as 'Top' for at least one key outcome. The majority of effects of individual QI strategies were modest, but when used in combination could result in meaningful population-level improvements across the majority of outcomes. The median number of QI strategies in multicomponent QI programmes was three.Â  Combinations of the three most effective QI strategies were estimated to lead to the below effects:Â  - PR + PSM + CE: decrease in HbA1c by 0.41% (credibility interval (CrI) -0.61 to -0.22) when baseline HbA1c < 8.3%; - CM + PE + EPR: decrease in HbA1c by 0.62% (CrI -0.84 to -0.39) when baseline HbA1c > 8.3%;Â  - PE + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 2.14 mmHg (CrI -3.80 to -0.52) when baseline SBP < 136 mmHg; - CM + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 4.39 mmHg (CrI -6.20 to -2.56) when baseline SBP > 136 mmHg;Â  - TC + PE + CM: LDL-C lowering of 5.73 mg/dL (CrI -7.93 to -3.61) when baseline LDL < 107 mg/dL; - TC + CM + CR: LDL-C lowering by 5.52 mg/dL (CrI -9.24 to -1.89) when baseline LDL > 107 mg/dL. Assuming a baseline screening rate of 50%, the three most effective QI strategies were estimated to lead to an absolute improvement of 33% in retinopathy screening (PE + PR + TC) and 38% absolute increase in foot screening (PE + TC + Other). There is a significant body of evidence about QI programmes to improve the management of diabetes. Multicomponent QI programmes for diabetes care (comprised of effective QI strategies) may achieve meaningful population-level improvements across the majority of outcomes. For health system decision-makers, the evidence summarised in this review can be used to identify strategies to include in QI programmes. For researchers, this synthesis identifies higher-priority QI strategies to examine in further research regarding how to optimise their evaluation and effects. We will maintain this as a living systematic review.

### 15. Access to New Clinic Appointments for Patients With Cancer.
**Authors:** Debbie W Chen, Mousumi Banerjee, Brittany Gay, Yi-Chun Wang, Lesley Miranda, Maya Watanabe, Christine M Veenstra, Megan R Haymart

**Abstract:** Racial and ethnic disparities have been observed in the outpatient visit rates for specialist care, including cancer care; however, little is known about patients' experience at the critical step of attempting to access new clinic appointments for cancer care. To determine simulated English-speaking, Spanish-speaking, and Mandarin-speaking patient callers' ability to access new clinic appointments for 3 cancer types (colon, lung, and thyroid cancer) that disproportionately impact Hispanic and Asian populations. This cross-sectional audit study was conducted between November 2021 and March 2023 using 479 clinic telephone numbers that were provided by the hospital general information personnel at 143 hospitals located across 12 US states. Using standardized scripts, trained research personnel assigned to the roles of English-speaking, Spanish-speaking, and Mandarin-speaking patients called the telephone number for a clinic that treats colon, lung, or thyroid cancer to inquire about a new clinic appointment. Data analysis was conducted from June to September 2023. The primary outcome was whether the simulated patient caller was able to access cancer care (binary variable, yes or no), which was defined to include being provided with a clinic appointment date or scheduling information. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine factors independently associated with simulated patient callers being able to access cancer care. Of 985 total calls (399 English calls; 302 Spanish calls; 284 Mandarin calls), simulated patient callers accessed cancer care in 409 calls (41.5%). Differences were observed based on language type, with simulated English-speaking patient callers significantly more likely to access cancer care compared with simulated Spanish-speaking and Mandarin-speaking patient callers (English, 245 calls [61.4%]; Spanish, 110 calls [36.4%]; Mandarin, 54 calls [19.0%]; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). A substantial number of calls ended due to linguistic barriers (291 of 586 Spanish or Mandarin calls [49.7%]) and workflow barriers (239 of 985 calls [24.3%]). Compared with English-speaking simulated patient callers, the odds of accessing cancer care were lower for Spanish-speaking simulated patient callers (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.34; 95% CI, 0.25-0.46) and Mandarin-speaking simulated patient callers (aOR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.09-0.19). Compared with contacting clinics affiliated with teaching hospitals, callers had lower odds of accessing cancer care when contacting clinics that were affiliated with nonteaching hospitals (aOR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.40-0.70). In this cross-sectional audit study, simulated patient callers encountered substantial barriers when attempting to access clinic appointments for cancer care. These findings suggest that interventions focused on mitigating these barriers are necessary to increase access to cancer care for all patients.

### 16. Musical experience may help the brain respond to second language reading.
**Authors:** Cuicui Wang, Sha Tao, Qin Tao, Mari Tervaniemi, Fali Li, Peng Xu

**Abstract:** A person's native language background exerts constraints on the brain's automatic responses while learning a second language. It remains unclear, however, whether and how musical experience may help the brain overcome such constraints and meet the requirements of a second language. This study compared native Chinese English learners who were musicians, non-musicians and native English readers on their automatic brain automatic integration of English letter-sounds with an ERP cross-modal audiovisual mismatch negativity paradigm. The results showed that native Chinese-speaking musicians successfully integrated English letters and sounds, but their non-musician peers did not, despite of their comparable English learning experience and proficiency level. However, native Chinese-speaking musicians demonstrated enhanced cross-modal MMN for both synchronized and delayed letter-sound integration, while native English readers only showed enhanced cross-modal MMN for synchronized integration. Moreover, native Chinese-speaking musicians showed stronger theta oscillations when integrating English letters and sounds, suggesting that they had better top-down modulation. In contrast, native English readers showed stronger delta oscillations for synchronized integration, and their cross-modal delta oscillations significantly correlated with English reading performance. These findings suggest that long-term professional musical experience may enhance the top-down modulation, then help the brain efficiently integrating letter-sounds required by the second language. Such benefits from musical experience may be different from those from specific language experience in shaping the brain's automatic responses to reading.

### 17. Reliability and validity of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) for detecting perinatal common mental disorders (PCMDs) among women in low-and lower-middle-income countries: a systematic review.
**Authors:** Sumitra Devi Shrestha, Rina Pradhan, Thach D Tran, Rosa C Gualano, Jane R W Fisher

**Abstract:** The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), originally developed in Britain, is one of the most widely used screening instruments for assessing symptoms of the Perinatal Common Mental Disorders (PCMDs) of depression and anxiety. However, its potential to detect PCMDs in culturally diverse low- and lower-middle income countries (LALMICs) is unclear. This systematic review aimed to appraise formally validated local language versions of the EPDS from these resource-constrained settings. Following the PRISMA protocol, we searched MEDLINE-OVID, CINAHL-Plus and PUBMED to identify studies reporting translation, cultural adaptation and formal validation of the EPDS to detect PCMDs among women in LALMICs. The quality of the studies meeting inclusion criteria was assessed using standard criteria and a new process-based criteria; which was developed specifically for this study. We identified 1281 records among which 16 met inclusion criteria; three further papers were identified by hand-searching reference lists. The publications reported findings from 12 LALMICs in 14 native languages. Most of these local language versions of the EPDS (LLV-EPDS) had lower precision for identifying true cases of PCMDs among women in the general perinatal population compared to the original English version. Only one study met all criteria for culturally sensitive translation, the others had not established the comprehensibility of the local version amongst representative groups of women in pre-testing. Many studies tested the LLV-EPDS only amongst convenience samples recruited at single health facilities. Diagnostic interviews for confirmation of mental disorders could have been influenced by the mental health professionals' lack of blinding to the initial screening results. Additionally, even when diagnostic-interviews were carried out in the local language, questions might not have been understood as most studies followed standard diagnostic protocol which had not been culturally adapted. Most of the LLV-EPDS from non-English speaking low- and middle-income-countries did not meet all criteria for formal validation of a screening instrument. Psychometric properties of LLV-EPDS could be enhanced by adopting the new process-based criteria for translation, adaptation and validation.

### 18. Probiotics for management of functional abdominal pain disorders in children.
**Authors:** Chris Wallace, Morris Gordon, Vassiliki Sinopoulou, Anthony K Akobeng

**Abstract:** Functional abdominal pain is pain occurring in the abdomen that cannot be fully explained by another medical condition and is common in children. It has been hypothesised that the use of micro-organisms, such as probiotics and synbiotics (a mixture of probiotics and prebiotics), might change the composition of bacterial colonies in the bowel and reduce inflammation, as well as promote normal gut physiology and reduce functional symptoms. To assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics in the treatment of functional abdominal pain disorders in children. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and two clinical trials registers from inception to October 2021. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compare probiotic preparations (including synbiotics) to placebo, no treatment or any other interventional preparation in patients aged between 4 and 18 years of age with a diagnosis of functional abdominal pain disorder according to the Rome II, Rome III or Rome IV criteria. The primary outcomes were treatment success as defined by the primary studies, complete resolution of pain, improvement in the severity of pain and improvement in the frequency of pain. Secondary outcomes included serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, adverse events, school performance or change in school performance or attendance, social and psychological functioning or change in social and psychological functioning, and quality of life or change in quality life measured using any validated scoring tool. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95% CI. We included 18 RCTs assessing the effectiveness of probiotics and synbiotics in reducing the severity and frequency of pain, involving a total of 1309 patients. Probiotics may achieve more treatment success when compared with placebo at the end of the treatment, with 50% success in the probiotic group versus 33% success in the placebo group (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.36; 554 participants; 6 studies; I The results from this review demonstrate that probiotics and synbiotics may be more efficacious than placebo in achieving treatment success, but the evidence is of low certainty. The evidence demonstrates little to no difference between probiotics or synbiotics and placebo in complete resolution of pain. We were unable to draw meaningful conclusions about the impact of probiotics or synbiotics on the frequency and severity of pain as the evidence was all of very low certainty due to significant unexplained heterogeneity or imprecision. There were no reported cases of serious adverse events when using probiotics or synbiotics amongst the included studies, although a review of RCTs may not be the best context to assess long-term safety. The available evidence on adverse effects was of very low certainty and no conclusions could be made in this review. Safety will always be a priority in paediatric populations when considering any treatment. Reporting of all adverse events, adverse events needing withdrawal, serious adverse events and, particularly, long-term safety outcomes are vital to meaningfully move forward the evidence base in this field. Further targeted and appropriately designed RCTs are needed to address the gaps in the evidence base. In particular, appropriate powering of studies to confirm the safety of specific strains not yet investigated and studies to investigate long-term follow-up of patients are both warranted.

### 19. Language skills of adults with dyslexia in English as a foreign language: proposal of a language spontaneity deficit hypothesis.
**Authors:** Uxue PÃ©rez-Litago, JosuÃ© M Rojas-Guerra, Cristina MartÃ­nez-GarcÃ­a, Paz SuÃ¡rez-Coalla

**Abstract:** Developmental dyslexia is characterized by reading and writing deficits that persist into adulthood. However, the mechanisms underlying these deficits appear to affect several language domains negatively. The present study aims to investigate how 18 native Spanish-speaking adults with developmental dyslexia perform different language tasks in English as a foreign language. For this purpose, reading and oral comprehension were performed along with written and oral production tasks by adults with dyslexia and their control peers. The results suggest that Spanish adults with dyslexia need more time to read English texts, and their reading comprehension is significantly worse than that of the control group. In written production, differences from the control group were found in the number of spelling errors. In addition, the oral productions showed differences in semantic errors, lexical diversity, and sentence complexity. Interestingly, the group differences for all measures were greater for the oral than for the written production tasks, leading to the hypothesis that this population is negatively affected by the spontaneity of the situation. In terms of practical implications, it seems important to provide special support for adults with dyslexia not only for written language learning but also for oral language learning in English.

### 21. Probing for congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction.
**Authors:** Carisa Petris, Don Liu

**Abstract:** Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) is a common condition causing excessive tearing in the first year of life. Infants present with excessive tearing or mucoid discharge from the eyes due to blockage of the nasolacrimal duct system, which can result in maceration of the skin of the eyelids and local infections, such as conjunctivitis, that may require antibiotics. The incidence of nasolacrimal duct obstruction in early childhood ranges from 5% to 20% and often resolves without surgery. Treatment options for this condition are either conservative therapy, including observation (or deferred probing), massage of the lacrimal sac and antibiotics, or probing the nasolacrimal duct to open the membranous obstruction at the distal nasolacrimal duct. Probing may be performed without anesthesia in the office setting or under general anesthesia in the operating room. Probing may serve to resolve the symptoms by opening the membranous obstruction; however, it may not be successful if the obstruction is due to a bony protrusion of the inferior turbinate into the nasolacrimal duct or when the duct is edematous (swollen) due to infection such as dacryocystitis. Additionally, potential complications with probing include creation of a false passage and injury to the nasolacrimal duct, canaliculi and puncta, bleeding, laryngospasm, or aspiration. To assess the effects of probing for congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register (2016, Issue 8); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 30 August 2016); Embase.com (1947 to 30 August 2016); PubMed (1948 to 30 August 2016); LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database; 1982 to 30 August 2016), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), last searched 14 August 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), searched 30 August 2016; and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en), searched 30 August 2016. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared probing (office-based or hospital-based under general anesthesia) versus no (or deferred) probing or other interventions (observation alone, antibiotic drops only, or antibiotic drops plus massage of the nasolacrimal duct). We did not include studies that compared different probing techniques or probing compared with other surgical procedures. We included studies in children aged three weeks to four years who may have presented with tearing and conjunctivitis. Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion and independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for the included studies. We analyzed data using Review Manager software and evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We identified two RCTs and no ongoing studies; one of the included RCTs was registered. The studies reported on 303 eyes of 242 participants who had unilateral or bilateral congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction. For both included studies, the interventions compared were immediate office-based probing to remove the duct obstruction versus deferred probing, if needed, after 6 months of observation or once the child reached a certain age.The primary outcome of the review, treatment success at 6 months, was reported partially in one study. Treatment success was not reported at this time point for all children in the immediate probing group; however, 77 of 117 (66%) eyes randomized to deferred probing had resolved without surgery 6 months after randomization and 40 (34%) eyes did not resolve without probing. For children who had unilateral NLDO, those randomized to immediate probing had treatment success more often than those who were randomized to deferred probing (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.78; 163 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Treatment success for all children was assessed in the study at age 18 months; as an ad hoc analysis in the included study, results were presented separately for children with unilateral and bilateral NLDO (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.28 and RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.06, respectively; very low-certainty evidence).In the other small study (26 eyes of 22 children), more eyes that received immediate probing were cured within one month after surgery compared with eyes that were randomized to deferred probing and analyzed at age 15 months (RR 2.56, 95% CI 1.16 to 5.64). We considered the evidence to be low-certainty due to imprecision from the small study size and risk of bias concerns due to attrition bias.One study reported on the number of children that required reoperation; however, these data were reported only for immediate probing group. Nine percent of children with unilateral NLDO and 13% with bilateral NLDO required secondary procedures.One study reported cost-effectiveness of immediate probing versus deferred probing. The mean cost of treatment for immediate probing was less than for deferred probing; however, there is uncertainty as to whether there is a true cost difference (mean difference USD -139, 95% CI USD -377 to 94; moderate-certainty evidence).Reported complications of the treatment were not serious. One study reported that there were no complications for any surgery and no serious adverse events, while the other study reported that bleeding from the punctum occurred in 20% of all probings. The effects and costs of immediate versus deferred probing for NLDO are uncertain. Children who have unilateral NLDO may have better success from immediate office probing, though few children have participated in these trials, and investigators examined outcomes at disparate time points. Determining whether to perform the procedure and its optimal timing will require additional studies with greater power and larger, well-run clinical trials to help our understanding of the comparison.

### 22. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents for treating cystoid macular edema following cataract surgery.
**Authors:** Andreas M Wingert, Su-Hsun Liu, John C Lin, Jayanth Sridhar

**Abstract:** Cataract surgery is the most common ambulatory incisional surgery performed in the USA. Cystoid macular edema (CME), the accumulation of fluid in the central retina due to leakage from dilated capillaries, is the most common cause of vision impairment following cataract surgery. Acute CME, defined as CME of less than four months' duration, often resolves spontaneously. CME that persists for four months or longer is termed chronic CME. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been used to treat CME. This update adds new evidence and analyses to the previously published review. To examine the effectiveness of NSAIDs in the treatment of CME following cataract surgery. We searched the CENTRAL (2022, Issue 3); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase; PubMed; LILACS; mRCT (discontinued in 2014, last searched August 2011), ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP databases. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 20 March 2022. Â  SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of NSAIDs for CME following cataract surgery. Two review authors independently screened all titles and abstracts, reviewed full-text publications against eligibility criteria, independently extracted data from newly included trials and assessed risk of bias for each included trial. We contacted trial authors for clarification or to request missing information. We provided a narrative synthesis of all included trials and their results. For continuous and dichotomous outcomes, we separately performed pooled analysis and reported mean difference (MD) and risk ratio (RR) as well asÂ the associated 95% confidence interval (CI) whenever feasible. Two review authors independently graded the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. We included nine trials with a total of 390 participants (393 eyes). Study participants' mean age was 72.2 years (interquartile range [IQR] 68.8 to 73.6) and 72% were women (IQR 69% to 74%). Three trials included participants with acute CME, and four included participants with chronic CME; the remaining two trials enrolled both participants with acute and chronic CME or participants with unknown CME duration. We assessed trials as having unclear (33%) or high risk of bias (67%). Visual improvement of two or more lines at the end of treatmentÂ  Data from one trial in participants with acute CME show no treatment effect of topical ketorolac compared to placebo (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.46 to 8.76; 22 participants). Data from a three-arm trial in participants with acute CME demonstrate that, when compared with topical prednisolone, topical ketorolac (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.58 to 3.07; 17 participants) or topical ketorolac and prednisolone combination therapy (RR 1.78, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.69; 17 participants) may have little or no effect on visual improvement. Results of subgroup analysis from two studies in participants with chronic CME suggest that, after treatment for 90 days or longer, NSAIDs may increase participants' likelihood of visual improvement by 1.87 fold (RR 2.87, 95% CI 1.58 to 5.22; I Evidence on effects of NSAIDs in patients with CME is very uncertain and further investigation is warranted. Our findings are limited by small sample sizes, and heterogeneity in interventions, assessments, and reporting of clinically important outcomes.

### 23. The agreement of phonetic transcriptions between paediatric speech and language therapists transcribing a disordered speech sample.
**Authors:** Laura Jane Mallaband

**Abstract:** Speech and language therapists (SLTs) regularly use phonetic transcription to record and analyse typical and disordered speech. Phonetic transcription is highly demanding of auditory perceptual skills so researchers are sceptical about its accuracy and reliability. The literature describes how phonetic transcription is prone to auditory illusions and biases, such as a preference to transcribe speech sounds from the transcriber's own language. Few empirical research studies have calculated agreement amongst transcribers where a range of agreement scores have been reported (51%-97%). There is a consensus that agreement rates decrease as phonetic detail increases. Vowels and consonants are characterised by different perceptual features within the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) so they may differ in agreement rates, and thus far there is contradictory evidence as to whether vowels or consonants are more agreed upon. Transcription agreement studies to date have most commonly recruited phoneticians rather than SLTs so further research is warranted to determine transcription agreement amongst SLTs and its impact on clinical practice. The study's primary aim was to calculate agreement scores from a group of English-speaking SLTs who transcribed disordered speech samples in an ecologically valid setting. The study also sought to contribute to the pre-existing contradictory evidence base regarding whether vowels or consonants may be more agreed upon by comparing their agreement scores. The researcher aimed to comment on SLTs' use of diacritics and non-native speech symbols (symbols not included in the English phonetic inventory) in terms of their frequency and agreement of use. By analysing transcriptions, the study aimed to discuss the impact transcription variability has on speech sound error patterns and thus its impact on clinical decision-making such as diagnosis, choice of intervention and therapy targets. Twelve paediatric SLTs were recruited via a convenience sample at two National Health Service trusts, two of whom were specialists in Speech Sound Disorders (SSDs). Participants transcribed 16 words from a video of a boy with disordered speech completing the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology (DEAP, Dodd etÂ al., 2006) from a telehealth appointment. The use of diacritics and non-English IPA symbols were manually analysed. A classic agreement score was calculated for each target word using a Python script, and then for vowels and consonants in isolation. Datasets were manually analysed to determine whether differences in transcription resulted in the identification of different speech sound error patterns. The researcher considered the implications this had within clinical practice. The average classic agreement score was 56.3%. Consonants were more agreed upon than vowels with agreement scores of 62.8% and 48.6%, respectively. Nine participants (75%) used diacritics (most commonly length marks) and eight participants (67%) transcribed non-native IPA symbols at least once in their datasets, but generally with low frequencies and agreements amongst their use. Transcriptions captured the occurrence of typical and atypical error patterns but only three error patterns, out of the 20 identified, were present in all 12 participants' transcriptions. The agreement score of 56.3% questions the accuracy and reliability of transcription amongst SLTs which is an essential skill of the profession. The findings highlight SLTs should be more cautious of interpreting vowels than consonants given lower agreement rates. The frequency of use of non-native symbols and diacritics was relatively low which could reflect a low accuracy of their use or reduced confidence in transcribing these. The study discussed how variations in transcriptions can impact phonological and phonetic analysis, which in turn can influence clinical decision-making such as diagnosing SSDs, selecting further diagnostic assessments and choosing therapy targets and interventions. The Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists-endorsed transcription guidelines (Child Speech Disorder Research Network, 2017) could be revised to convey realistic expectations of SLTs' transcription skills, or SLTs should be offered more training to improve transcription skills to meet current expectations. Other suggestions to improve transcription accuracy are discussed such as via instrumental methods, yet these come with their own limitations such as practicality, costs and need for specialist training. What is already known on this subject Phonetic transcription is highly demanding of human perceptual skills, and researchers are sceptical about its reliability. There are few empirical research studies calculating agreement amongst transcribers, and a range of agreement scores have been reported (51%-97%) dependent on the research conditions. Research mostly involves experienced transcribers (e.g., phoneticians) rather than speech and language therapists (SLTs), a profession expected to regularly use phonetic transcription to record and analyse typical and disordered speech. What this study adds to existing knowledge A range of transcription agreement scores have been reported in previous studies, mainly comparing pairs or small groups of specialist transcribers rather than SLTs. This study provides an agreement score of 56.3% when a group of 12 SLTs transcribed a disordered speech sample in an ecologically valid setting (where speech samples were taken from a real-life speech sound assessment over a telehealth appointment using the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology). The study found consonants are more agreed upon than vowels, adding to the contradictory evidence base. Unlike other studies, the researcher analysed transcriptions to identify error patterns to examine the impact that transcription variation has on clinical decision-making. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? The researcher questions whether SLTs are meeting the expectations of 'accurate transcription' as listed by the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT) endorsed transcription guidelines (Child Speech Disorder Research Network, 2017) given the relatively low agreement score of 56.3%. The study also questions the reliability of the use of diacritics and non-English International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols and whether SLTs should be expected to use these due to perceptual limitations. Twenty phonological processes emerged from the datasets, only three of which were agreed upon across all 12 participants. The researcher therefore discusses how transcription variations could result in different diagnoses, therapy targets and interventions choices. The paper suggests more training is required to enhance transcription accuracy, and also considers the appropriateness of utilising instrumental methods whilst recognising its limitations such as feasibility, costs and specialist training needs.

### 24. Aural toilet (ear cleaning) for chronic suppurative otitis media.
**Authors:** Mahmood F Bhutta, Karen Head, Lee Yee Chong, Jessica Daw, Anne Gm Schilder, Christopher G Brennan-Jones

**Abstract:** Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Aural toileting describes processes for manually cleaning the ear, including dry mopping (with cotton wool or tissue paper), suction clearance (typically under a microscope), or irrigation (using manual or automated syringing). Aural toileting can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or topical antiseptics. This is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM. This is the first update of a Cochrane review published in 2020. To assess the benefits and harms of aural toilet procedures for people with chronic suppurative otitis media. We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The searches were run on 15 June 2022. We included randomised controlled trials with at least a one-week follow-up involving adults or children who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. We included any aural toileting method as the intervention, at any frequency, and for any duration. The main comparisons were aural toileting versus placebo or no intervention, and one aural toileting method versus another aural toileting method. Within each comparison, we separated studies into those in which both groups received other concomitant treatments (e.g. antiseptics or antibiotics) and those without concomitant treatments. We used standard Cochrane methodology. Our primary outcomes were resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at one week to up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and adverse events (dizziness/vertigo/balance problems, ear bleeding). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. This update did not find any new studies. We included three studies with 431 participants (465 ears) reporting on two comparisons. Two studies included only children with CSOM in the community (351 participants) and the other study (80 participants) included children and adults with chronic ear discharge for at least six weeks. One study recruited participants from the Solomon Islands, who were considered a 'high-risk' Indigenous group. None of the included studies reported health-related quality of life, ear pain, or ear bleeding. 1. Daily aural toileting versus no treatment Two studies (351 children; 370 ears) compared daily dry mopping with no treatment. For resolution of ear discharge after four weeks, only one study reported the results per person. We are very uncertain whether there is a difference at 16 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.72; 1 study, 217 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no results reported for the adverse events of dizziness, vertigo, or balance problems. Only one study reported serious complications, but it was not clear which group these participants were from, or whether the complications occurred pre- or post-treatment, and therefore the certainty of evidence was very low. One study reported hearing, but the results were presented by treatment outcome rather than by treatment group, so it was not possible to determine whether there was a difference between the two groups. 2. Daily aural toileting versus single aural toileting episode (both in addition to topical ciprofloxacin) One study (80 participants; 95 ears) compared daily aural toileting (suction) with administration of topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) ear drops in a clinic, to a single aural toileting (suction) episode followed by daily self-administered topical antibiotic drops, in participants of all ages. We are very uncertain if there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge at between one and up to two weeks (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.30; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks were presented by ear, not person, and could not be adjusted to by person. The authors only reported qualitatively that there was no difference between the two groups in hearing results (very low-certainty evidence). One participant in the group with single aural toileting and self-administration of topical antibiotic ear drops reported the adverse event of dizziness, which the authors attributed to the use of cold topical ciprofloxacin. It is very uncertain whether there is a difference between the groups (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.95; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no results reported for the other adverse events of vertigo or balance problems, or for serious complications. We are very uncertain whether treatment with aural toileting is effective in resolving ear discharge in people with CSOM when compared to no treatment, due to a lack of data and the poor quality of the available evidence. The evidence was considered very low-certainty as there were concerns over risk of bias, indirectness, imprecision, and suspected publication bias. We also remain uncertain about other outcomes, including adverse events, as these were not well reported. Similarly, we are very uncertain whether daily suction clearance, followed by antibiotic ear drops administered at a clinic, is better than a single episode of suction clearance followed by self-administration of topical antibiotic ear drops. Limitations of the review include lack of recency in data, and limited information on certain population groups or interventions.

### 25. Dexrazoxane for preventing or reducing cardiotoxicity in adults and children with cancer receiving anthracyclines.
**Authors:** EsmÃ©e C de Baat, RenÃ©e L Mulder, Saro Armenian, Elizabeth Am Feijen, Heynric Grotenhuis, Melissa M Hudson, Annelies Mc Mavinkurve-Groothuis, Leontien Cm Kremer, Elvira C van Dalen

**Abstract:** This review is the third update of a previously published Cochrane Review. The original review, looking at all possible cardioprotective agents, was split and this part now focuses on dexrazoxane only. Anthracyclines are effective chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of numerous malignancies. Unfortunately, their use is limited by a dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. In an effort to prevent or reduce this cardiotoxicity, different cardioprotective agents have been studied, including dexrazoxane. To assess the efficacy of dexrazoxane to prevent or reduce cardiotoxicity and determine possible effects of dexrazoxane on antitumour efficacy, quality of life and toxicities other than cardiac damage in adults and children with cancer receiving anthracyclines when compared to placebo or no additional treatment. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to May 2021. We also handsearched reference lists, the proceedings of relevant conferences and ongoing trials registers. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which dexrazoxane was compared to no additional therapy or placebo in adults and children with cancer receiving anthracyclines. Two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction, risk of bias and GRADE assessment of included studies. We analysed results in adults and children separately. We performed analyses according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For this update, we identified 548 unique records. We included three additional RCTs: two paediatric and one adult. Therefore, we included a total of 13 eligible RCTs (five paediatric and eight adult). The studies enrolled 1252 children with leukaemia, lymphoma or a solid tumour and 1269 participants, who were mostly diagnosed with breast cancer. In adults, moderate-quality evidence showed that there was less clinical heart failure with the use of dexrazoxane (risk ratio (RR) 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.43; 7 studies, 1221 adults). In children, we identified no difference in clinical heart failure risk between treatment groups (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.19; 3 studies, 885 children; low-quality evidence). In three paediatric studies assessing cardiomyopathy/heart failure as the primary cause of death, none of the children had this outcome (1008 children, low-quality evidence). In the adult studies, different definitions for subclinical myocardial dysfunction and clinical heart failure combined were used, but pooled analyses were possible: there was a benefit in favour of the use of dexrazoxane (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.56; 3 studies, 417 adults and RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.66; 2 studies, 534 adults, respectively, moderate-quality evidence). In the paediatric studies, definitions of subclinical myocardial dysfunction and clinical heart failure combined were incomparable, making pooling impossible. One paediatric study showed a benefit in favour of dexrazoxane (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.85; 33 children; low-quality evidence), whereas another study showed no difference between treatment groups (Fischer exact P = 0.12; 537 children; very low-quality evidence). Overall survival (OS) was reported in adults and overall mortality in children. The meta-analyses of both outcomes showed no difference between treatment groups (hazard ratio (HR) 1.04, 95% 0.88 to 1.23; 4 studies; moderate-quality evidence; and HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.42; 3 studies, 1008 children; low-quality evidence, respectively). Progression-free survival (PFS) was only reported in adults. We subdivided PFS into three analyses based on the comparability of definitions, and identified a longer PFS in favour of dexrazoxane in one study (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.90; 164 adults; low-quality evidence). There was no difference between treatment groups in the other two analyses (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.40; 1 study; low-quality evidence; and HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.43; 2 studies; moderate-quality evidence, respectively). In adults, there was no difference in tumour response rate between treatment groups (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.04; 6 studies, 956 adults; moderate-quality evidence). We subdivided tumour response rate in children into two analyses based on the comparability of definitions, and identified no difference between treatment groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.07; 1 study, 206 children; very low-quality evidence; and RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01; 1 study, 200 children; low-quality evidence, respectively). The occurrence of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN) was only assessed in children. The available and worst-case analyses were identical and showed a difference in favour of the control group (RR 3.08, 95% CI 1.13 to 8.38; 3 studies, 1015 children; low-quality evidence). In the best-case analysis, the direction of effect was the same, but there was no difference between treatment groups (RR 2.51, 95% CI 0.96 to 6.53; 4 studies, 1220 children; low-quality evidence). For other adverse effects, results also varied. None of the studies evaluated quality of life. If not reported, the number of participants for an analysis was unclear. Our meta-analyses showed the efficacy of dexrazoxane in preventing or reducing cardiotoxicity in adults treated with anthracyclines. In children, there was a difference between treatment groups for one cardiac outcome (i.e. for one of the definitions used for clinical heart failure and subclinical myocardial dysfunction combined) in favour of dexrazoxane. In adults, no evidence of a negative effect on tumour response rate, OS and PFS was identified; and in children, no evidence of a negative effect on tumour response rate and overall mortality was identified. The results for adverse effects varied. In children, dexrazoxane may be associated with a higher risk of SMN; in adults this was not addressed. In adults, the quality of the evidence ranged between moderate and low; in children, it ranged between low and very low. Before definitive conclusions on the use of dexrazoxane can be made, especially in children, more high-quality research is needed. We conclude that if the risk of cardiac damage is expected to be high, it might be justified to use dexrazoxane in children and adults with cancer who are treated with anthracyclines. However, clinicians and patients should weigh the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane against the possible risk of adverse effects, including SMN, for each individual. For children, the International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group has developed a clinical practice guideline.

### 26. Antidepressant treatment for postnatal depression.
**Authors:** Emma Molyneaux, Louise M Howard, Helen R McGeown, Amar M Karia, Kylee Trevillion

**Abstract:** Postnatal depression is a common disorder that can have adverse short- and long-term effects on maternal morbidity, the new infant and the family as a whole. Treatment is often largely by social support and psychological interventions. It is not known whether antidepressants are an effective and safe choice for treatment of this disorder. This review was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of different antidepressants and to compare their effectiveness with other forms of treatment, placebo or treatment as usual. It is an update of a review first published in 2001. To assess the effectiveness of antidepressant drugs in comparison with any other treatment (psychological, psychosocial or pharmacological), placebo or treatment as usual for postnatal depression. We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialized Register (CCDANCTR) to 11 July 2014. This register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE, (1974 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We also searched international trial registries and contacted pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field. We included RCTs of women with depression with onset up to six months postpartum that compared antidepressant treatment (alone or in combination with another treatment) with any other treatment, placebo or treatment as usual. Two review authors independently extracted data from the trial reports. We requested missing information from investigators wherever possible. We sought data to allow an intention-to-treat analysis. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to pool data where sufficient comparable studies were identified. We included six trials with 596 participants in this review. All studies had a randomised controlled parallel group design, with two conducted in the UK, three in the US and one in Israel. Meta-analyses were performed to pool data on response and remission from studies comparing antidepressants with placebo. No meta-analyses could be conducted for other comparisons due to the small number of trials identified.Four studies compared selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with placebo (two using sertraline, one using paroxetine and one using fluoxetine; 233 participants in total). In two of these studies both the experimental and placebo groups also received psychological therapy. Pooled risk ratios based on data from three of these studies (146 participants) showed that women randomised to SSRIs had higher rates of response and remission than those randomised to placebo (response: RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.03; remission: RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.98); the fourth study did not report data on response or remission.One study (254 participants) compared antidepressant treatment with treatment as usual (for the first four weeks) followed by listening visits. The study found significantly higher rates of improvement in the antidepressant group than treatment-as-usual group after the first four weeks, but no difference between antidepressants and listening visits at the later follow-up. In addition, one study comparing sertraline with nortriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant) found no difference in effectiveness (109 participants).Side effects were experienced by a substantial proportion of women, but there was no evidence of a meaningful difference in the number of adverse effects between treatment arms in any study. There were very limited data on adverse effects experienced by breastfed infants, with no long-term follow-up. All but one of the studies were assessed as being at high or uncertain risk of attrition bias and selective outcome reporting. In particular, one of the placebo-controlled studies had over 50% drop-out. The evidence base for this review was very limited, with a small number of studies and little information on a number of important outcomes, particularly regarding potential effects on the child. Risk of bias, for example from high attrition rates, as well as low representativeness of participants (e.g. exclusion of women with severe or chronic depression in several trials) also limit the conclusions that can be drawn.Pooled estimates for response and remission found that SSRIs were significantly more effective than placebo for women with postnatal depression. However the quality of evidence contributing to this comparison was assessed as very low owing to the small sample size for this comparison (146 participants from three studies), the risk of bias in included studes and the inclusion of one study where all participants in both study arms additionally received psychological therapy. There was insufficient evidence to conclude whether, and for whom, antidepressant or psychological/psychosocial treatments are more effective, or whether some antidepressants are more effective or better tolerated than others. There is also inadequate evidence on whether the benefits of antidepressants persist beyond eight weeks or whether they have short- or long-term adverse effects on breastfeeding infants.Professionals treating women with severe depression in the postnatal period will need to draw on other evidence, including trials among general adult populations and observational studies of antidepressant safety when breastfeeding (although the potential for confounding in non-randomised studies must be considered). More RCTs are needed with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up, including assessment of the impact on the child and safety of breastfeeding. Further larger-scale trials comparing antidepressants with alternative treatment modalities are also required.

### 27. Sertindole for schizophrenia.
**Authors:** R Lewis, A-M Bagnall, M Leitner

**Abstract:** Sertindole is an atypical antipsychotic, which is thought to give a lower incidence of extrapyramidal side effects at clinically effective doses than typical antipsychotic drugs. In December 1998, Lundbeck Ltd., the manufacturers of sertindole, voluntarily suspended the availability of the drug due to concerns about cardiac arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death associated with its use. However, based on the advice of an appointed expert group, the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) lifted the suspension of sertindole in October 2001, a decision that was ratified by the European Commission on the 26th of June 2002. Lundbeck have committed to the CPMP to carry out two post-marketing surveillance (PMS) studies (which were initiated in July 2002) to provide additional epidemiological data under conditions of normal drug usage. Initial marketing of the product will be restricted and Lundbeck is currently in discussions with the US health authorities (FDA) to investigate whether, and if so when, it would be possible to launch Serdolect in the US market. To determine the effects of sertindole compared with placebo, typical and other atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and related psychoses. Our Initial searches included electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1980-1999), The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 1999), The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (August 2000), EMBASE (1980-1999), LILACS (1982-1996), MEDLINE (1966-1999), PSYNDEX (1977-1995) and PsycLIT (1974-1999). In addition, we searched pharmaceutical databases on the Dialog Corporation Datastar and Dialog services. We searched references of all identified studies for further trials. We contacted the manufacturer of sertindole and authors of trials. We updated the literature search by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register in April 2003. All randomised controlled trials that compared sertindole to placebo or other antipsychotic (atypical or typical) drug treatments for patients with schizophrenia or related psychosis . We independently inspected citations and, where possible abstracts; ordered papers for re-inspection and quality assessment and independently extracted data. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT) or number needed to harm (NNH) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). We inspected all data for heterogeneity. Currently the review includes three studies with a total of 1,104 participants. One was a medium term (eight weeks) placebo controlled study that examined three different doses of sertindole (8, 12 and 20mg/day). The remaining two studies compared the use of sertindole with haloperidol (10mg/day). One was a short term study (six weeks) that looked at four different doses of sertindole (8, 16, 20, 24mg/day) and the other was a long term study (one year) that evaluated the use of sertindole 24mg/day in participants attending outpatients. We excluded two large important studies because they did not report any usable data. (Both had greater than 50% loss to follow-up and data on 'leaving the study early' was inadequately reported). SERTINDOLE VERSUS PLACEBO: Sertindole at 20mg/day was found to be more effective than placebo in terms of BPRS total scores (1 study, n=78, MD 6.2, CI -11.8 to -0.6) and CGI total end point scores (1 study, n=78, MD -0.9, CI -1.6 to -0.2). A marginally statistically significantly greater number of participants that were treated with 20 mg of sertindole were reported to have been 'very much improved' as compared to those taking placebo (1 study, n=102, RR 7.6, CI 1.0 to 57.9, NNT 7.9, CI 4.3 to 41.1). There was no statistically significant difference between sertindole at 8 or 12 mg/day and placebo for these three outcome measures. There were no statistically significant differences between sertindole (8, 12 or 20 mg) and placebo for the incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms, extrapyramidal related events or use of medication to avoid extrapyramidal symptoms. There were no statistically significant differences found between sertindole and placebo for the movement disorders akathisia, cogwheel rigidity, hypertonia and tremor or somnolence. At eight weeks a statistically significant difference between placebo and all sertindole groups (8, 12 and 20 mg) for mean change from baseline in the QT and QTc intervals were observed (p values and SD were not reported). There was a statistically significant greater mean weight gain among participants taking sertindole (20 mg, mean weight gain of 3.3 kg) as compared to placebo (mean weight gain of 0.8 kg; p<0.05). SERTINDOLE VERSUS HALOPERIDOL: At one year, a greater number of participants who were treated with haloperidol as compared to sertindole (24mg/day) were leaving the study early due to any reason (1 study, n=282, RR 0.6, CI 0.4 to 1.0, NNH 8.8, CI 4.7 to 74.0) or non-compliance (1 study, n=282, RR 0.2, CI 0.0 to 0.7, NNH 12.8, CI 7.7 to 37.8). However, at six weeks, there was no statistically significant difference between sertindole (at 8, 16, 20, or 24mg) and haloperidol for this latter outcome. The incidence of EPS was higher among those treated with haloperidol than sertindole at 8, 16, 20 or 24mg/day (8mg: 1 study, n=245, RR 0.1, CI 0.0 to 0.7, NNH 11.4, CI 7.1 to 29.8; 16mg: 1 study, n=252, RR 0.3, CI 0.1 to 1.0, NNH 15.5, CI 8.0 to 217.9; and 20mg: 1 study, n=253, RR 0.2, CI 0.1 to 0.8, NNH 13.7, CI 7.7 to 68.3; 24mg: 2 studies, n=524, RR 0.6, CI 0.4 to 0.8, NNH 8.7, CI 5.4 to 23.0). More participants treated with haloperidol experienced akathisia, tremor and hypertonia than those treated with sertindole (Akathisia - 8mg: 1 study, n=245, RR 0.2, CI 0.1 to 0.5, NNH 6.0, CI 4.1 to 11.2; 16mg: 1 study, n=252, RR 0.1, CI 0.0 to 0.3, NNH 5.4, CI 3.9 9.0; 20mg: 1 study, n=253, RR 0.3, CI 0.2 to 0.7, NNH 7.3, CI 4.6 to 17.9; 24mg: 2 studies, n=524, RR 0.5, CI 0.3 to 0.7, NNH 8.6, CI 5.6 to 18.3. Tremor - 8mg: 1 study, n=245, RR 0.3, CI 0.1 to 0.7, NNH 8.5, CI 5.2 to 24.0; 16mg: 1 study, n=252, RR 0.2, CI 0.1 to 0.5, NNH 7.3, 4.8 to 15.6; 20mg: 1 study, n=253, RR 0.2, CI 0.1 to 0.6, NNH 7.8, CI 4.9 to 18.1; 24mg: 2 studies, n=524, RR 0.4, CI 0.2 to 0.6, NNH 8.2, CI 5.6 to 15.3. For Hypertonic - 24mg: 2 studies, n=524, RR 0.5, CI 0.3 to 0.8, NNH 12.4, CI 7.5 to 35.0; for sertindole 8, 16 and 20mg there was no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups). One study reported that at six weeks, there was a statistically significant greater increase from baseline to final value in mean QTc interval in the sertindole 16, 20 and 24mg groups (20, 26, and 24msec, respectively) than in the haloperidol group (0msec; p value was not reported), but no SD or any other measure of variance for the effect sizes were reported. For one long term study only one participant from the sertindole group (24mg) had a QT interval that exceeded 500msec (1 study, n=282, RR 3.0 CI 0.1 to 73.0), but 11participants treated with Sertindole had QTc intervals of at least 500msec, compared to none in the haloperidol treated group (1 study, n=282, RR 23.0, CI 1.4 to 386.6, NNH 12.8, CI 8.2 to 29.6). At six weeks, fewer participants treated with sertindole at 8mg or 24mg were affected by somnolence than those treated with haloperidol (sertindole 8mg: 1 study, n=245, RR 0.1, CI 0.0 to 0.7, NNH 11.4, CI 7.1 to 29.8; 24mg: 2 studies, n=524, RR 0.6, CI 0.4 to 1.0, NNH 14.8, CI 7.7 to 205.2). The incidence of rhinitis was found to be statistically significantly higher among those taking sertindole at 16 or 24mg as compared to haloperidol (16mg: 1 study, n=252, RR 10.8, CI 1.4 to 82.6, NNH 12.7, CI 7.7 to 36.7; 24mg: 2 studies, n= 524, RR 2.1, CI 1.4 to 3.1, NNH 8.7, CI 5.6 to 18.6). At one year, 33 participants treated with sertindole (24mg) had experienced the sexual adverse event of decreased ejaculatory volume, compared with six participants treated with haloperidol. However the number of included male participants was not reported and therefore the RR could not be calculated. At one year, more participants taking sertindole (24mg/day) had put on weight compared to those taking haloperidol (1 study, n=282, RR 6.3, CI 1.9 to 20.9, NNH 8.8, CI 5.7 to 19.1). At six weeks, all of the sertindole groups showed an increase in body weight from baseline to final evaluation ranging from 1.3kg to 1.9kg, all of which represented a statistically significantly different weight change than that recorded for the haloperidol treatment group (-0.1Kg). However, the actual weight gain for each sertindole dosage group was not reported and no SD or any other measure of variance was given. Sertindole at a dose of 20mg/day was found to be more antipsychotic than placebo. When used at 8, 12 or 20mg/day it appears to be as acceptable as placebo (in terms of various adverse events including movement disorders and somnolence), but seems to be associated with more cardiac problems (8, 12 or 20mg/day) and an increase in weight gain (20mg/day) than placebo. Sertindole at a dose of 24mg/day was better tolerated than haloperidol (in terms of participants leaving the study early). It was also found to be was associated with fewer movement disorders (at 8, 16, 20 or 24mg/day) and sedation (8 or 24mg/day) than haloperidol. However, it was shown to cause more cardiac anomalies (16, 20 or 24mg/day), weight gain (all doses combined), rhinitis (16 or 24mg/day), and problems with sexual functioning (24mg/day) than haloperidol. One short term study reported that sertindole 16mg/day was the most optimal dose.

### 28. Prophylactic mastectomy for the prevention of breast cancer.
**Authors:** L Lostumbo, N Carbine, J Wallace, J Ezzo

**Abstract:** Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related death among North American and Western European women. Recent progress in understanding the genetic basis of breast cancer, along with rising incidence rates, have resulted in increased interest in prophylactic mastectomy as a method of preventing breast cancer, particularly in those with familial susceptibility. The primary objective was to determine whether prophylactic mastectomy reduces death from any cause in women who have never had breast cancer and in women who have a history of breast cancer in one breast. The secondary objective was to examine the effect of prophylactic mastectomy on other endpoints including breast cancer incidence, breast cancer mortality, disease-free survival, physical morbidity, and psychosocial outcomes. Electronic searches were performed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cancerlit, and the Science Citation Index. Inclusion criteria were studies in English of any design type including randomized or nonrandomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, and case series with at least ten participants. Participants included women at risk for breast cancer in at least one breast. Interventions included all types of mastectomy performed for the purpose of preventing breast cancer, including subcutaneous mastectomy, total or simple mastectomy, modified radical mastectomy, and radical mastectomy. Information on patients, interventions, methods, and results were extracted by at least two independent reviewers. Methodological quality was assessed based on how well each study minimized potential selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, and attrition bias. Data for each study were summarized descriptively; quantitative meta-analysis was not feasible due to heterogeneity of study designs and insufficient reporting. Data were analyzed separately for bilateral prophylactic mastectomy (BPM) and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM). Twenty-three studies, including more than 4,000 patients, met inclusion criteria. No randomized or nonrandomized controlled trials were found. Most studies were either case series or cohort studies. All studies had methodological limitations, with the most common source of potential bias being systematic differences between the intervention and comparison groups that could potentially be associated with a particular outcome. Thirteen studies assessed the effectiveness of BPM. No study assessed all-cause mortality after BPM. All studies reporting on incidence of breast cancer and disease-specific mortality reported reductions after BPM. Nine studies assessed psychosocial measures; most reported high levels of satisfaction with the decision to have prophylactic mastectomy (PM) but more variable satisfaction with cosmetic results. Only one study assessed satisfaction with the psychological support provided by healthcare personnel during risk counseling and showed that more women were dissatisfied than satisfied with the support they received in the healthcare setting. Worry over breast cancer was significantly reduced after BPM when compared both to baseline worry levels and to the groups who opted for surveillance rather than BPM. Three studies reported body image/feelings of femininity outcomes, and all reported that a substantial minority (about 20%) reported BPM had adverse effects on those domains. Six studies assessed contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. Studies consistently reported reductions in contralateral incidence of breast cancer but were inconsistent about improvements in disease-specific survival. Only one study attempted to control for multiple differences between intervention groups, and this study showed no overall survival advantage for CPM at 15 years. Two case series were exclusively focused on adverse events from prophylactic mastectomy with reconstruction, and both reported rates of unanticipated re-operations from 30% to 49%. While published observational studies demonstrated that BPM was effective in reducing both the incidence of, and death from, breast cancer, more rigorous prospective studies (ideally randomized trials) are needed. The studies need to be of sufficient duration and make better attempts to control for selection biases to arrive at better estimates of risk reduction. The state of the science is far from exact in predicting who will get or who will die from breast cancer. By one estimate, most of the women deemed high risk by family history (but not necessarily BRCA 1 or 2 mutation carriers) who underwent these procedures would not have died from breast cancer, even without prophylactic surgery. Therefore, women need to understand that this procedure should be considered only among those at very high risk of the disease. For women who had already been diagnosed with a primary tumor, the data were particularly lacking for indications for contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. While it appeared that contralateral mastectomy may reduce the incidence of cancer in the contralateral breast, there was insufficient evidence about whether, and for whom, CPM actually improved survival. Physical morbidity is not uncommon following PM, and many women underwent unanticipated re-operations (usually due to problems with reconstruction); however, these data need to be updated to reflect changes in surgical procedures and reconstruction. Regarding psychosocial outcomes, women generally reported satisfaction with their decisions to have PM but reported satisfaction less consistently for cosmetic outcomes, with diminished satisfaction often due to surgical complications. Therefore, physical morbidity and post-operative surgical complications were areas that should be considered when deciding about PM. With regard to emotional well-being, most women recovered well postoperatively, reporting reduced cancer worry and showing reduced psychological morbidity from their baseline measures; exceptions also have been noted. Of the psychosocial outcomes measured, body image and feelings of femininity were the most adversely affected.

### 29. Translation and validation of the Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) Exam for older adults in Thailand: The SLUMS-Thai.
**Authors:** Komwat Rungruang, Pornpun Manasatchakun, Sarinya Polsingchan

**Abstract:** The Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) Exam is a commonly used tool for screening cognitive function, particularly for detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early dementia. It was developed to overcome limitations in existing cognitive assessments by evaluating a broad range of domains, including language comprehension, executive function, memory, and attention. While effective in English-speaking populations, its use in non-English-speaking settings is limited by language and cultural differences. In Thailand, the lack of linguistically and culturally adapted cognitive screening tools can lead to inaccurate assessments. To ensure reliable and valid evaluations in older Thai adults, the SLUMS must be appropriately translated and culturally adapted. This study aimed to translate the SLUMS into Thai (SLUMS-Thai) and validate its use among older adults in Thailand. The translation process consisted of seven steps: establishing the expert team, synthesizing the translated version, forward translation, pilot testing to ensure clarity, cultural appropriateness testing, blind back-translation, and translation equivalence testing. The study involved 100 older adults. Validation was performed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlations, the Index of Item-Objective Congruence (IOC), and Cronbach's alpha coefficients. The findings showed that cultural appropriateness was assessed using expert evaluations on the relevance and sensitivity of the tool to Thai cultural norms and practices, with the rate of appropriateness at the highest level (Mean = 4.97, SD = 0.71), and translation equivalence was also rated highly (Mean = 4.76, SD = 0.27). The correlation between the original SLUMS and the SLUMS-Thai was strong ( The SLUMS-Thai demonstrated acceptable content validity and strong psychometric properties that were linguistically and culturally appropriate. As a consequence, the SLUMS-Thai can be used to screen older persons for dementia and mild cognitive impairment in Thailand and may be helpful for modifying interventions for accurate diagnosis and cognitive function assessment.

### 30. Pediatric Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Restrictive and Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: A Single Center Experience.
**Authors:** Diana L Geisser, Bryan D Siegel, Ryan L Kobayashi, Christina J VanderPluym, Francis Fynn-Thompson, Ravi R Thiagarajan, Katie M Moynihan

**Abstract:** Patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) were previously considered poor candidates for mechanical circulatory support due to technical limitations related to restrictive ventricular physiology and small ventricular size, limiting the ability to provide adequate flows and decompress the heart. Literature examining use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in this population consists of a single case series reporting no survivors. We report our experience providing ECMO in children with RCM or HCM at a large pediatric quaternary cardiac center. Between 2012 and 2022, five patients (four RCM, one HCM) were supported with seven ECMO runs. All patients were cannulated to ECMO with ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Four patients survived decannulation from ECMO (median support time 209â€‰hr, interquartile range [IQR]: 48-265), of which three (60%) survived to hospital discharge after transitioning to a ventricular assist device (VAD) and undergoing orthotopic heart transplant (OHT). Two remain alive at long-term follow-up with normal or mildly impaired functional status. These findings suggest that while RCM and HCM have traditionally been considered contraindications to ECMO due to adverse outcomes, this population may be successfully supported with ECMO with survival comparable to international registry outcomes in select centers where VAD as a bridge to OHT is available.

### 31. Physical exercise training interventions for children and young adults during and after treatment for childhood cancer.
**Authors:** Katja I Braam, Patrick van der Torre, Tim Takken, Margreet A Veening, Eline van Dulmen-den Broeder, Gertjan J L Kaspers

**Abstract:** A decreased physical fitness has been reported in patients and survivors of childhood cancer. This is influenced by the negative effects of the disease and the treatment of childhood cancer. Exercise training for adult cancer patients has frequently been reported to improve physical fitness. In recent years, literature on this subject has also become available for children and young adults with cancer, both during and after treatment. This is an update of the original review that was performed in 2011. To evaluate the effect of a physical exercise training intervention on the physical fitness (i.e. aerobic capacity, muscle strength, or functional performance) of children with cancer within the first five years from their diagnosis (performed either during or after cancer treatment), compared to a control group of children with cancer who did not receive an exercise intervention.To determine whether physical exercise within the first five years of diagnosis has an effect on fatigue, anxiety, depression, self efficacy, and HRQoL and to determine whether there are any adverse effects of the intervention. We searched the electronic databases of Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PEDro; ongoing trial registries and conference proceedings on 6 September 2011 and 11 November 2014. In addition, we performed a handsearch of reference lists. The review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical controlled trials (CCTs) that compared the effects of physical exercise training with no training, in people who were within the first five years of their diagnosis of childhood cancer. Two review authors independently identified studies meeting the inclusion criteria, performed the data extraction, and assessed the risk of bias using standardized forms. Study quality was rated by the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Apart from the five studies in the original review, this update included one additional RCT. In total, the analysis included 171 participants, all during treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).The duration of the training sessions ranged from 15 to 60 minutes per session. Both the type of intervention and intervention period varied in all the included studies. However, the control group always received usual care.All studies had methodological limitations, such as small numbers of participants, unclear randomization methods, and single-blind study designs in case of one RCT and all results were of moderate to very low quality (GRADE).Cardiorespiratory fitness was evaluated by the 9-minute run-walk test, timed up-and-down stairs test, the timed up-and-go time test, and the 20-m shuttle run test. Data of the 9-minute run-walk test and the timed up-and-down stairs test could be pooled. The combined 9-minute run-walk test results showed significant differences between the intervention and the control groups, in favour of the intervention group (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 1.35). Pooled data from the timed up-and-down stairs test showed no significant differences in cardiorespiratory fitness (SMD -0.54; 95% CI -1.77 to 0.70). However, there was considerable heterogeneity (I(2) = 84%) between the two studies on this outcome. The other two single-study outcomes, 20-m shuttle run test and the timed up-and-go test, also showed positive results for cardiorespiratory fitness in favour of the intervention group.Only one study assessed the effect of exercise on bone mineral density (total body), showing a statistically significant positive intervention effect (SMD 1.07; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.66). The pooled data on body mass index showed no statistically significant end-score difference between the intervention and control group (SMD 0.59; 95% CI -0.23 to 1.41).Three studies assessed flexibility. Two studies assessed ankle dorsiflexion. One study assessed active ankle dorsiflexion, while the other assessed passive ankle dorsiflexion. There were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control group with the active ankle dorsiflexion test; however, in favour of the intervention group, they were found for passive ankle dorsiflexion (SMD 0.69; 95% CI 0.12 to 1.25). The third study assessed body flexibility using the sit-and-reach distance test, but identified no statistically significant difference between the intervention and control group.Three studies assessed muscle strength (knee, ankle, back and leg, and inspiratory muscle strength). Only the back and leg strength combination score showed statistically significant differences on the muscle strength end-score between the intervention and control group (SMD 1.41; 95% CI 0.71 to 2.11).Apart from one sub-scale of the cancer scale (Worries; P value = 0.03), none of the health-related quality of life scales showed a significant difference between both study groups on the end-score. For the other outcomes of fatigue, level of daily activity, and adverse events (all assessed in one study), there were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control group.None of the included studies evaluated activity energy expenditure, time spent on exercise, anxiety and depression, or self efficacy as an outcome. The effects of physical exercise training interventions for childhood cancer participants are not yet convincing. Possible reasons are the small numbers of participants and insufficient study designs, but it can also be that this type of intervention is not as effective as in adult cancer patients. However, the first results show some positive effects on physical fitness in the intervention group compared to the control group. There were positive intervention effects for body composition, flexibility, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, and health-related quality of life (cancer-related items). These were measured by some assessment methods, but not all. However, the quality of the evidence was low and these positive effects were not found for the other assessed outcomes, such as fatigue, level of daily activity, and adverse events. There is a need for more studies with comparable aims and interventions, using a higher number of participants that also include diagnoses other than ALL.

### 32. Sex and gender as predictors for allograft and patient-relevant outcomes after kidney transplantation.
**Authors:** Sumedh Jayanti, Nadim A Beruni, Juanita N Chui, Danny Deng, Amy Liang, Anita S Chong, Jonathan C Craig, Bethany Foster, Martin Howell, Siah Kim, Roslyn B Mannon, Ruth Sapir-Pichhadze, Nicole J Scholes-Robertson, Alexandra T Strauss, Allison Jaure, Lori West, Tess E Cooper, Germaine Wong

**Abstract:** Sex, as a biological construct, and gender, defined as the cultural attitudes and behaviours attributed by society, may be associated with allograft loss, death, cancer, and rejection. Other factors, such as recipient age and donor sex, may modify the association between sex/gender and post-transplant outcomes. We sought to evaluate the prognostic effects of recipient sex and, separately, gender as independent predictors of graft loss, death, cancer, and allograft rejection following kidney or simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation. We aimed to evaluate this prognostic effect by defining the relationship between recipient sex or gender and post-transplantation outcomes identifying reasons for variations between sexes and genders, and then quantifying the magnitude of this relationship. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception up to 12 April 2023, through contact with the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Information Specialist, using search terms relevant to this review and no language restrictions. Cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies were included if sex or gender were the primary exposure and clearly defined. Studies needed to focus on our defined outcomes post-transplantation. Sex was defined as the chromosomal, gonadal, and anatomical characteristics associated with the biological sex, and we used the terms "males" and "females". Gender was defined as the attitudes and behaviours that a given culture associates with a person's biological sex, and we used the terms "men" and "women". Two authors independently assessed the references for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Whenever appropriate, we performed random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the mean difference in outcomes. The outcomes of interest included the Standardised Outcomes in Nephrology-Kidney Transplant (SONG-Tx) core outcomes, allograft loss, death, cancer (overall incidence and site-specific) and acute or chronic graft rejection. Fifty-three studies (2,144,613 patients; range 59 to 407,963) conducted between 1990 and 2023 were included. Sixteen studies were conducted in the Americas, 12 in Europe, 11 in the Western Pacific, four in the Eastern Mediterranean, three in Africa, two in Southeast Asia, and five across multiple regions. All but one study focused on sex rather than gender as the primary exposure of interest. The number identified as male was 54%; 49 studies included kidney transplant recipients, and four studies included SPK transplant recipients. Twenty-four studies included adults and children, 25 studies included only adults, and four studies included only children. Data from 33 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Among these, six studies presented unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs) that assessed the effect of recipient sex on kidney allograft loss. The other studies reported risk ratios (RRs) for the pre-defined outcomes. Notably, the decision to restrict the meta-analyses to unadjusted estimates arose from the variation in covariate adjustment methods across studies, lacking a common set of adjusted variables. Only three studies considered the modifying effect of recipient age on graft loss or death, which is likely crucial to evaluating sex differences in post-transplant outcomes. No studies considered the modifying effect of recipient age on cancer incidence or allograft rejection risk. In low certainty evidence, compared with male recipients, being female may make little or no difference in kidney allograft loss post-transplantation (7 studies, 5843 patients: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.12; I There is very low to low certainty evidence to suggest there are no differences in kidney and pancreas allograft survival, patient survival, cancer, and acute and chronic allograft rejection between male and female kidney and SPK transplant recipients.

### 33. Psychological therapies for post-traumatic stress disorder and comorbid substance use disorder.
**Authors:** Neil P Roberts, Pamela A Roberts, Neil Jones, Jonathan I Bisson

**Abstract:** Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating mental health disorder that may develop after exposure to traumatic events. Substance use disorder (SUD) is a behavioural disorder in which the use of one or more substances is associated with heightened levels of distress, clinically significant impairment of functioning, or both. PTSD and SUD frequently occur together. The comorbidity is widely recognised as being difficult to treat and is associated with poorer treatment completion and poorer outcomes than for either condition alone. Several psychological therapies have been developed to treat the comorbidity, however there is no consensus about which therapies are most effective. To determine the efficacy of psychological therapies aimed at treating traumatic stress symptoms, substance misuse symptoms, or both in people with comorbid PTSD and SUD in comparison with control conditions (usual care, waiting-list conditions, and no treatment) and other psychological therapies. We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) all years to 11 March 2015. This register contains relevant randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov, contacted experts, searched bibliographies of included studies, and performed citation searches of identified articles. Randomised controlled trials of individual or group psychological therapies delivered to individuals with PTSD and comorbid substance use, compared with waiting-list conditions, usual care, or minimal intervention or to other psychological therapies. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We included 14 studies with 1506 participants, of which 13 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. Most studies involved adult populations. Studies were conducted in a variety of settings. We performed four comparisons investigating the effects of psychological therapies with a trauma-focused component and non-trauma-focused interventions against treatment as usual/minimal intervention and other active psychological therapies. Comparisons were stratified for individual- or group-based therapies. All active interventions were based on cognitive behavioural therapy. Our main findings were as follows.Individual-based psychological therapies with a trauma-focused component plus adjunctive SUD intervention was more effective than treatment as usual (TAU)/minimal intervention for PTSD severity post-treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.72 to -0.10; 4 studies; n = 405; very low-quality evidence) and at 3 to 4 and 5 to 7 months' follow-up. There was no evidence of an effect for level of drug/alcohol use post-treatment (SMD -0.13; 95% CI -0.41 to 0.15; 3 studies; n = 388; very low-quality evidence), but there was a small effect in favour of individual psychological therapy at 5 to 7 months (SMD -0.28; 95% CI -0.48 to -0.07; 3 studies; n = 388) when compared against TAU. Fewer participants completed trauma-focused therapy than TAU (risk ratio (RR) 0.78; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.96; 3 studies; n = 316; low-quality evidence).Individual-based psychological therapy with a trauma-focused component did not perform better than psychological therapy for SUD only for PTSD severity (mean difference (MD) -3.91; 95% CI -19.16 to 11.34; 1 study; n = 46; low-quality evidence) or drug/alcohol use (MD -1.27; 95% CI -5.76 to 3.22; 1 study; n = 46; low-quality evidence). Findings were based on one small study. No effects were observed for rates of therapy completion (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.36; 1 study; n = 62; low-quality evidence).Non-trauma-focused psychological therapies did not perform better than TAU/minimal intervention for PTSD severity when delivered on an individual (SMD -0.22; 95% CI -0.83 to 0.39; 1 study; n = 44; low-quality evidence) or group basis (SMD -0.02; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.16; 4 studies; n = 513; low-quality evidence). There were no data on the effects on drug/alcohol use for individual therapy. There was no evidence of an effect on the level of drug/alcohol use for group-based therapy (SMD -0.03; 95% CI -0.37 to 0.31; 4 studies; n = 414; very low-quality evidence). A post-hoc analysis for full dose of a widely established group therapy called Seeking Safety showed reduced drug/alcohol use post-treatment (SMD -0.67; 95% CI -1.14 to -0.19; 2 studies; n = 111), but not at subsequent follow-ups. Data on the number of participants completing therapy were not for individual-based therapy. No effects were observed for rates of therapy completion for group-based therapy (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.45; 2 studies; n = 217; low-quality evidence).Non-trauma-focused psychological therapy did not perform better than psychological therapy for SUD only for PTSD severity (SMD -0.26; 95% CI -1.29 to 0.77; 2 studies; n = 128; very low-quality evidence) or drug/alcohol use (SMD 0.22; 95% CI -0.13 to 0.57; 2 studies; n = 128; low-quality evidence). No effects were observed for rates of therapy completion (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.20; 2 studies; n = 128; very low-quality evidence).Several studies reported on adverse events. There were no differences between rates of such events in any comparison. We rated several studies as being at 'high' or 'unclear' risk of bias in multiple domains, including for detection bias and attrition bias. We assessed the evidence in this review as mostly low to very low quality. Evidence showed that individual trauma-focused psychological therapy delivered alongside SUD therapy did better than TAU/minimal intervention in reducing PTSD severity post-treatment and at long-term follow-up, but only reduced SUD at long-term follow-up. All effects were small, and follow-up periods were generally quite short. There was evidence that fewer participants receiving trauma-focused therapy completed treatment. There was very little evidence to support use of non-trauma-focused individual- or group-based integrated therapies. Individuals with more severe and complex presentations (e.g. serious mental illness, individuals with cognitive impairment, and suicidal individuals) were excluded from most studies in this review, and so the findings from this review are not generalisable to such individuals. Some studies suffered from significant methodological problems and some were underpowered, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn. Further research is needed in this area.

### 34. Transfusion thresholds for guiding red blood cell transfusion.
**Authors:** Jeffrey L Carson, Simon J Stanworth, Jane A Dennis, Marialena Trivella, Nareg Roubinian, Dean A Fergusson, Darrell Triulzi, Carolyn DorÃ©e, Paul C HÃ©bert

**Abstract:** The optimal haemoglobin threshold for use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients remainsÂ an active field of research.Â Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than in others because of inadequate testing for viral pathogens. If a liberal transfusion policy does not improve clinical outcomes, or if it is equivalent, then adopting a more restrictive approach could be recognised as the standard of care.Â  OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review update was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes for participants randomised to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all clinical conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin concentrationÂ as a threshold forÂ transfusion (most commonly, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL). We identified trialsÂ through updated searches: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2020), Embase (1974 to November 2020), Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to November 2020), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 toÂ November 2020), and trial registries (NovemberÂ 2020). WeÂ  checked the reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify additional trials. We were aware of one trial identified in earlier searching that was in the process of being published (in February 2021), and we were able to include it before this review was finalised. We included randomised trials of surgical or medical participants that recruited adults or children, or both. We excluded studies that focused on neonates. Eligible trials assigned intervention groups on the basis of different transfusion schedules or thresholds or 'triggers'. These thresholds would be defined by a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) concentrationÂ below which anÂ RBCÂ transfusion would be administered; theÂ haemoglobin concentration remains the most commonly applied markerÂ of the need for RBC transfusion in clinical practice.Â We included trials in which investigators had allocated participants to higher thresholds or more liberal transfusion strategies compared to more restrictive ones, which might include no transfusion. As in previous versions of this review, we did not exclude unregistered trials published after 2010 (as per the policy of the Cochrane Injuries Group, 2015), however, we did conduct analyses to consider the differential impact of results of trials for which prospective registration could not be confirmed. Â  DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified trials for inclusion and extracted data using Cochrane methods. We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random-effects model. Two review authorsÂ independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as being in the 'restrictive transfusion' group and those randomly allocated to the higher transfusion threshold as being in the 'liberal transfusion' group. A total ofÂ 48Â trials, involving data from 21,433 participants (at baseline), across a range of clinical contexts (e.g. orthopaedic, cardiac, or vascular surgery; critical care; acute blood loss (including gastrointestinal bleeding); acute coronary syndrome; cancer; leukaemia; haematological malignancies), met the eligibility criteria. The haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group in most trials (36) was between 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. Â Most trials included only adults; three trials focused on children. The included studies were generally at low risk of bias for key domains including allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving at least one RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts (risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.66; 42 studies, 20,057Â participants; high-quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (IÂ² = 96%). Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30-day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15; 31 studies, 16,729 participants; IÂ² = 30%; moderate-quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low-quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (all high-quality evidence)). High-quality evidence shows that the liberal transfusion threshold did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound infection, or bacteraemia). Transfusion-specific reactions are uncommon and were inconsistently reported within trials. We noted less certainty in the strength of evidence to support the safety of restrictive transfusion thresholds for the following predefined clinical subgroups: myocardial infarction, vascular surgery, haematological malignancies, and chronic bone-marrow disorders. TransfusionÂ at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration decreased the proportion of people exposed to RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts. Across all trials, no evidence suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy impactedÂ 30-day mortality, mortality at other time points, or morbidity (i.e. cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. Despite including 17 more randomised trials (and 8846 participants), data remain insufficient to inform the safety of transfusion policies in important and selected clinical contexts, such as myocardial infarction, chronic cardiovascular disease, neurological injury or traumatic brain injury, stroke, thrombocytopenia, and cancer or haematological malignancies, including chronicÂ bone marrow failure.Â  Further work is needed to improve our understanding of outcomes other than mortality.Â Most trials compared only twoÂ separate thresholds for haemoglobin concentration, which may not identify theÂ actual optimal threshold for transfusion in a particular patient. Haemoglobin concentration may not be the most informative marker of the need for transfusion in individual patients with different degrees of physiological adaptation to anaemia. Notwithstanding these issues, overall findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds between the range of 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL.Â Some patient subgroupsÂ might benefit from RBCsÂ to maintain higher haemoglobin concentrations; research efforts should focus on these clinical contexts.

### 35. Dietary interventions for recurrent abdominal pain in childhood.
**Authors:** Tamsin V Newlove-Delgado, Alice E Martin, Rebecca A Abbott, Alison Bethel, Joanna Thompson-Coon, Rebecca Whear, Stuart Logan

**Abstract:** This is an update of the original Cochrane review, last published in 2009 (Huertas-Ceballos 2009). Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP), including children with irritable bowel syndrome, is a common problem affecting between 4% and 25% of school-aged children. For the majority of such children, no organic cause for their pain can be found on physical examination or investigation. Many dietary inventions have been suggested to improve the symptoms of RAP. These may involve either excluding ingredients from the diet or adding supplements such as fibre or probiotics. To examine the effectiveness of dietary interventions in improving pain in children of school age with RAP. We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, eight other databases, and two trials registers, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors, in June 2016. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing dietary interventions with placebo or no treatment in children aged five to 18 years with RAP or an abdominal pain-related, functional gastrointestinal disorder, as defined by the Rome III criteria (Rasquin 2006). We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We grouped dietary interventions together by category for analysis. We contacted study authors to ask for missing information and clarification, when needed. We assessed the quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. We included 19 RCTs, reported in 27 papers with a total of 1453 participants. Fifteen of these studies were not included in the previous review. All 19 RCTs had follow-up ranging from one to five months. Participants were aged between four and 18 years from eight different countries and were recruited largely from paediatric gastroenterology clinics. The mean age at recruitment ranged from 6.3 years to 13.1 years. Girls outnumbered boys in most trials. Fourteen trials recruited children with a diagnosis under the broad umbrella of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorders; five trials specifically recruited only children with irritable bowel syndrome. The studies fell into four categories: trials of probiotic-based interventions (13 studies), trials of fibre-based interventions (four studies), trials of low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) diets (one study), and trials of fructose-restricted diets (one study).We found that children treated with probiotics reported a greater reduction in pain frequency at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.98 to -0.12; 6 trials; 523 children). There was also a decrease in pain intensity in the intervention group at the same time point (SMD -0.50, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.15; 7 studies; 575 children). However, we judged the evidence for these outcomes to be of low quality using GRADE due to an unclear risk of bias from incomplete outcome data and significant heterogeneity.We found that children treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (odds ratio (OR) 1.63, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.47; 7 studies; 722 children). The estimated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was eight, meaning that eight children would need to receive probiotics for one to experience improvement in pain in this timescale. We judged the evidence for this outcome to be of moderate quality due to significant heterogeneity.Children with a symptom profile defined as irritable bowel syndrome treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.77 to 5.13; 4 studies; 344 children). Children treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at three to six months postintervention compared to those receiving placebo (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.43; 2 studies; 224 children). We judged the evidence for these two outcomes to be of moderate quality due to small numbers of participants included in the studies.We found that children treated with fibre-based interventions were not more likely to experience an improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than children given placebo (OR 1.83, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.65; 2 studies; 136 children). There was also no reduction in pain intensity compared to placebo at the same time point (SMD -1.24, 95% CI -3.41 to 0.94; 2 studies; 135 children). We judged the evidence for these outcomes to be of low quality due to an unclear risk of bias, imprecision, and significant heterogeneity.We found only one study of low FODMAP diets and only one trial of fructose-restricted diets, meaning no pooled analyses were possible.We were unable to perform any meta-analyses for the secondary outcomes of school performance, social or psychological functioning, or quality of daily life, as not enough studies included these outcomes or used comparable measures to assess them.With the exception of one study, all studies reported monitoring children for adverse events; no major adverse events were reported. Overall, we found moderate- to low-quality evidence suggesting that probiotics may be effective in improving pain in children with RAP. Clinicians may therefore consider probiotic interventions as part of a holistic management strategy. However, further trials are needed to examine longer-term outcomes and to improve confidence in estimating the size of the effect, as well as to determine the optimal strain and dosage. Future research should also explore the effectiveness of probiotics in children with different symptom profiles, such as those with irritable bowel syndrome.We found only a small number of trials of fibre-based interventions, with overall low-quality evidence for the outcomes. There was therefore no convincing evidence that fibre-based interventions improve pain in children with RAP. Further high-quality RCTs of fibre supplements involving larger numbers of participants are required. Future trials of low FODMAP diets and other dietary interventions are also required to facilitate evidence-based recommendations.

### 36. Nitrates for the prevention of cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.
**Authors:** Na Zhao, Jin Xu, Balwinder Singh, Xuerong Yu, Taixiang Wu, Yuguang Huang

**Abstract:** Cardiac complications are not uncommon in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, especially in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or at high risk of CAD. Perioperative cardiac complications can lead to mortality and morbidity, as well as higher costs for patient care. Nitrates, which are among the most commonly used cardiovascular drugs, perform the function of decreasing cardiac preload while improving cardiac blood perfusion. Sometimes, nitrates are administered to patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery to reduce the incidence of cardiac complications, especially for patients with CAD. However, their effects on patients' relevant outcomes remain controversial. â€¢ To assess effects of nitrates as compared with other interventions or placebo in reducing cardiac risk (such as death caused by cardiac factors, angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction, acute heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia) in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.â€¢ To identify the influence of different routes and dosages of nitrates on patient outcomes. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Chinese BioMedical Database until June 2014. We also searched relevant conference abstracts of important anaesthesiology or cardiology scientific meetings, the database of ongoing trials and Google Scholar.We reran the search in January 2016. We added three potential new studies of interest to the list of 'Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate them into our formal review findings for the review update. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nitrates versus no treatment, placebo or other pharmacological interventions in participants (15 years of age and older) undergoing non-cardiac surgery under any type of anaesthesia. We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. Two review authors selected trials, extracted data from included studies and assessed risk of bias. We resolved differences by discussion and, when necessary, sought help and suggestions from a third review author. We used a random-effects model for data analysis. We included 27 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (8244 participants analysed). Investigators reported 12 different comparisons of three different nitrates (nitroglycerin, isosorbide dinitrate and nicorandil) versus no treatment, placebo or other pharmacological interventions. All participants were older than 15 years of age. More than half of the trials used general anaesthesia. Surgical procedures in most trials were at low to moderate risk for perioperative cardiac complications. Only two comparisons including three studies reported the primary outcome - all-cause mortality up to 30 days post operation. Researchers reported other morbidity outcomes and adverse events in a variable and heterogeneous way, resulting in limited available data for inclusion in the meta-analysis. We determined that the overall methodological quality of included studies was fair to low, in accordance with risk of bias in most domains.In summary, we found no difference in the primary outcome - all-cause mortality up to 30 days post operation - when nitroglycerin was compared with no treatment (one study, 60 participants, 0/30 vs 1/30; (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 7.87, very low-quality evidence based on GRADE criteria) or with placebo (two studies, 89 participants, 1/45 vs 0/44; RR 2.81, 95% CI 0.12 to 63.83, very low-quality evidence). Regarding our secondary outcomes, we noted no statistically significant differences in angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction, acute heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac arrest in any comparisons. In comparisons versus nitroglycerin, although more events of cardiac ischaemia were observed in participants receiving no treatment or placebo, we found no statistically significant differences in any comparisons, except the comparison of nicorandil versus placebo. One study revealed a potential dose-dependent protective effect of nicorandil for cardiac ischaemia.Adverse events were reported in a heterogeneous way among the comparisons. In general, more participants treated with nitrates had hypotension, tachycardia and headache, but investigators reported no statistically significant differences between groups in any comparisons. This systematic review suggests that nitroglycerin or isosorbide dinitrate is not associated with improvement in mortality and cardiac complications among patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Limited evidence suggests that nicorandil may reduce the risk of cardiac ischaemia in participants undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Additional studies are needed to consolidate the evidence.However, the data included in many of the analyses in this review are sparse - that is, adequate data are few - resulting in very low power to detect differences between nitrates and comparators. Thus, a more objective conclusion would state that available evidence is insufficient to show whether nitrates are associated with improvement in mortality and cardiac complications among patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.Over the past decade, no high-quality studies have focused on association of cardiac mortality and morbidity with use of nitrates during non-cardiac surgery. This review underlines the need for well-designed trials in this field.

### 38. Immunoglobulins, vaccines or interferon for preventing cytomegalovirus disease in solid organ transplant recipients.
**Authors:** E M Hodson, C A Jones, G F M Strippoli, A C Webster, J C Craig

**Abstract:** Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common virus causing disease and death in solid organ transplant recipients during the first six months post-transplant. Previous systematic reviews have demonstrated the efficacy of antiviral medications used prophylactically or pre-emptively in preventing CMV disease. In this review the efficacy of older agents (immunoglobulins (IgG), anti CMV vaccines and interferon) are examined. To assess the benefits and harms of IgG, anti CMV vaccines or interferon for preventing symptomatic CMV disease in solid organ transplant recipients. We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists and abstracts from conference proceedings without language restriction. Date of last search: December 2005 Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing IgG, anti CMV vaccine or interferon with placebo or no treatment, IgG alone or combined with antiviral medications with antiviral medications or IgG alone in recipients of any solid organ transplant. Two of four authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data from each trial. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and results expressed as relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Thirty seven trials (2185 participants) were included in this review. There was no significant difference in the risk for CMV disease (16 trials, 770 patients: RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.05), CMV infection (14 trials, 775 patients: RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.10) or all-cause mortality (8 trials, 502 patients: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.03) with IgG compared with placebo/no treatment. However IgG significantly reduced the risk of death from CMV disease (6 trials, 346 patients: RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80). There was no difference in the risk for CMV disease (4 trials, 298 patients: RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.86), CMV infection (4 trials, 298 patients: RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.52) or all-cause mortality (2 trials, 217 patients: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.29) between antiviral medication combined with IgG and antiviral medication alone. There was no significant difference in the risk of CMV disease with anti CMV vaccine or interferon compared with placebo or no treatment. Currently there are no indications for IgG in the prophylaxis of CMV disease in recipients of solid organ transplants.

### 39. Exercise-based rehabilitation for coronary heart disease.
**Authors:** J A Jolliffe, K Rees, R S Taylor, D Thompson, N Oldridge, S Ebrahim

**Abstract:** The burden of cardiovascular disease world-wide is one of great concern to patients and health care agencies alike. Circulatory diseases, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, kill more people than any other disease. Cardiac rehabilitation aims to restore patients who have suffered myocardial infarction to optimal health through exercise only based rehabilitation or comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (eg. smoking cessation advice, diet and counselling as well as exercise). Data from two published and widely cited meta-analyses (Oldridge 1988, O'Connor 1989) of over 4,000 patients each have demonstrated that patients randomised to exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation after MI have a statistically significant reduction in all-cause and cardiac mortality of about 20 to 25% compared to patients receiving conventional care. However, the trials included were small and often of poor methodological quality. Incomplete literature review methods may have resulted in publication bias thereby resulting in an over-estimate of the benefit of cardiac rehabilitation. The randomised controlled trials used in the reviews have focused almost exclusively on low-risk, middle-aged males post MI, thereby excluding women and the elderly. To determine the effectiveness of exercise only rehabilitation and exercise in addition to other rehabilitation interventions (termed comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation) compared with usual care on the mortality, morbidity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and modifiable cardiac risk factors of patients with coronary heart disease. Electronic databases were searched for randomised controlled trials, using standardised trial filters, from the earliest date available to December 31st 1998. Men and women of all ages, in both hospital-based and community-based settings, who have had myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or who have angina pectoris or coronary artery disease defined by angiography have been included. Studies involving participants following heart transplant, heart valve surgery or heart failure have been excluded. Follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. Studies were selected independently by two reviewers, and data extracted independently. Authors were contacted where possible to obtain missing information. The current systematic review has allowed analysis of an increased number of patients from approximately 4500 in the earlier meta-analyses to 7683 (2582 in exercise only and 5101 in the comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation group). The quality of reporting overall was poor, with generally high losses to follow up. The pooled effect estimate for total mortality for the exercise only intervention shows a 27% reduction in all cause mortality (random effects model OR 0.73 (0.54, 0.98)). Similarly, comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation reduced all cause mortality compared to usual care, but to a lesser degree (OR 0.87 (0.71, 1.05)). Total cardiac mortality was reduced by 31% (random effects model OR 0.69 (0.51, 0.94)) and 26% (random effects model OR 0.74 (0.57, 0.96)) in the exercise only and comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation intervention groups respectively when compared to usual care. Neither intervention had any effect on the ocurrence of non-fatal myocardial infarction. There was a significant net reduction in total cholesterol in the comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation group (pooled WMD random effects model -0.57 mmol/l (-0.83, -0.31)), but not the exercise only rehabilitation group. Similarly, LDL was significantly reduced in the comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation group (pooled WMD random effects model -0.51 mmol/l (-0.82, -0.19). The effect of exercise only rehabilitation or comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation interventions on revascularisation rates, blood pressure or smoking behaviour could not be determined by this meta-analysis due to the small number of trials reporting these outcomes and heterogeneity between trials. It was not possible to combine the data from studies reporting HRQoL as an outcome. Eighteen different instruments were used to assess HRQoL in the 11 studies reporting it as an outcome. The data are presented qualitatively, only one trial reporting significant improvements with the intervention. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation appears to be effective in reducing cardiac deaths but the evidence base is weakened by poor quality trials. It is not clear from this review whether exercise only or a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation intervention is more beneficial. The population studied in this review is still predominately male, middle aged and low risk. Identification of the ethnic origin of the participants was seldom reported. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

### 40. Early embryo developmental kinetics following IVF versus ICSI in patients without severe male factor infertility: a secondary analysis of a multicentre, randomized controlled trial (INVICSI).
**Authors:** Sine Berntsen, Anne Zedeler, Marie Louise GrÃ¸ndahl, Anette Vestergaard Gabrielsen, Morten RÃ¸nn Petersen, Dea FrÃ¸ding Skipper, Bugge NÃ¸hr, Anne Lis Englund, Ellen LÃ¸kkegaard, Lisbeth PrÃ¦torius, David Westergaard, Anja Pinborg, Henriette Svarre Nielsen, Nina la Cour Freiesleben

**Abstract:** Are there any differences in embryo development and morphokinetics between ICSI and conventional IVF (c-IVF) in first cycle patients without severe male factor infertility? ICSI resulted in fewer usable and high-quality blastocysts on Day 5 compared to c-IVF, with no observed differences in morphokinetics or cleavage patterns among patients without severe male factor infertility. Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ICSI and c-IVF have found that ICSI does not improve live birth rates compared to c-IVF when there is no severe male factor. Data on embryo development and morphokinetics between ICSI and c-IVF are lacking. This was a secondary analysis of an open-label, multicentre, RCT comparing ICSI and c-IVF in 824 patients without severe male factor infertility, with participants recruited between 29 November 2019 and 14 December 2022. In this secondary study, we aimed to explore potential differences in embryo development between ICSI and c-IVF by using registered data on embryo quality and destiny, along with time-lapse data on embryo morphokinetics and cleavage patterns. All analyses were carried out comparing per protocol results between the ICSI group and the c-IVF group. Eligible participants were women with a male partner who did not have severe male factor infertility, defined as a minimum of 2 million progressively motile spermatozoa, and women/couples using donor sperm. Data were collected on all retrieved oocytes from the study cycles, along with information on embryo development and utilization. Additionally, time-lapse data were extracted and analysed from three trial sites, allowing for the evaluation of morphokinetic parameters and cleavage patterns. The analysis included 388 participants in the ICSI group and 378 in the c-IVF group. There was no significant difference in the number of retrieved oocytes between the two groups. Compared to c-IVF, ICSI resulted in fewer 1PN and >2PN embryos. However, ICSI was also associated with fewer cleaved embryos on Day 2, lower total number of blastocysts, fewer blastocysts utilized for transfer or vitrification, and fewer high-quality blastocysts on Day 5 (based on Gardner's criteria) (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 for all). No significant differences were observed in the number of high-quality embryos on Day 2, high-quality blastocysts on Day 6 or vitrified Day 6 blastocysts. Blastocyst quality in the first embryo transfer did not differ between groups. The time-lapse imaging subgroup analysis included 482 participants (247 in the ICSI group and 235 in the c-IVF group), and assessment of 1846 ICSI-treated and 1900 c-IVF-treated oocytes. When accounting for an expected c-IVF delay, there were no differences in timing of embryo development between ICSI and c-IVF. No significant differences were found in the incidence of multinucleation at the two-cell or four-cell stage, direct cleavage, rolling or reverse cleavage. Traditional sperm parameters, including sperm count and motility, were used in this study. We did not assess sperm DNA fragmentation or other advanced sperm characteristics, which have been suggested to influence early embryonic development. This is the first study based on data from a randomized trial in which patients were assigned to either ICSI or c-IVF to examine the effect of fertilization method on embryo morphokinetics, cleavage patterns and blastocyst formation. ICSI resulted in fewer available blastocysts and high-quality blastocysts on Day 5 compared to c-IVF, while most other outcomes were comparable between groups. These findings are clinically relevant and add to the growing body of evidence that ICSI should not be preferred over c-IVF in the absence of severe male factor infertility.

**Abstract:** Selected patients with advanced heart failure ineligible for heart transplantation could benefit from left ventricular assist device therapy as 'destination therapy'. There is evidence of the efficacy of destination therapy; however, it is not currently commissioned within the United Kingdom National Health Service due to the lack of economic evidence. What is the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a left ventricular assist device compared to medical management for patients with advanced heart failure ineligible for heart transplantation (destination therapy)? A systematic review of evidence on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of left ventricular assist devices as destination therapy was undertaken including, where feasible, a network meta-analysis to provide an indirect estimate of the relative effectiveness of currently available left ventricular assist devices compared to medical management. For the systematic reviews, data sources searched (up to 11 January 2022) were Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE via Ovid for primary studies, and Epistemonikos and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for relevant systematic reviews. Trial registers were also searched, along with data and reports from intervention-specific registries. Economic studies were identified in EconLit, CEA registry and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED). The searches were supplemented by checking reference lists of included studies. An economic model (Markov) was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of left ventricular assist devices compared to medical management from the United Kingdom National Health Service/personal social service perspective. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore uncertainties. Where possible, all analyses focused on the only currently available left ventricular assist device (HeartMate 3 The clinical effectiveness review included 134 studies (240 articles). There were no studies directly comparing HeartMate 3 and medical management (a randomised trial is ongoing). The currently available left ventricular assist device improves patient survival and reduces stroke rates and complications compared to earlier devices and relative to medical management. For example, survival at 24 months is 77% with the HeartMate 3 device compared to 59% with the HeartMate II (MOMENTUM 3 trial). An indirect comparison demonstrated a reduction in mortality compared to medical management [relative risk of death 0.25 (95% confidence interval 0.13 to 0.47); 24 months; this study]. The cost-effectiveness review included 5 cost analyses and 14 economic evaluations covering different generations of devices and with different perspectives. The reported incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained compared to medical management were lower for later generations of devices [as low as Â£46,207 (2019 prices; United Kingdom perspective; time horizon at least 5 years)]. The economic evaluation used different approaches to obtain the relative effects of current left ventricular assist devices compared to medical management from the United Kingdom National Health Service/personal social service perspective. All gave similar incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of Â£53,496-58,244 per quality-adjusted life-year gained -Â lifetime horizon. Model outputs were sensitive to parameter estimates relating to medical management. The findings did not materially differ on exploratory subgroup analyses based on the severity of heart failure. There was no direct evidence comparing the clinical effectiveness of HeartMate 3 to medical management. Indirect comparisons made were based on limited data from heterogeneous studies regarding the severity of heart failure (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support score distribution) and possible for survival only. Furthermore, the cost of medical management of advanced heart failure in the United Kingdom is not clear. Using cost-effectiveness criteria applied in the United Kingdom, left ventricular assist devices compared to medical management for patients with advanced heart failure ineligible for heart transplant may not be cost-effective. When available, data from the ongoing evaluation of HeartMate 3 compared to medical management can be used to update cost-effectiveness estimates. An audit of the costs of medical management in the United Kingdom is required to further decrease uncertainty in the economic evaluation. This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42020158987.

### 42. Pediatric Diffuse High-Grade Gliomas: A Comprehensive Review Of Ad-vanced Methods Of Diagnosis And Treatment.
**Authors:** Roja Rani Budha, Saba Wahid Khan, Deep Chandraprakash Sharma, Yash Kulchandani, Koteswara Rao Gsn

**Abstract:** Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor, posing significant challenges in diagnosis and treatment, particularly in children. Understanding the pathogenesis, molecular biology, symptom presentation, and imaging features of GBM is vital for effective therapy. This review summarizes current knowledge on pediatric GBM, focusing on diagnosis and treatment. GBM typically arises from the cerebral hemispheres, with gross features marked by heterogeneous morphology and aggressive cell populations. Recent advances in genomic research have shed light on distinct molecular pathways associated with primary and secondary GBMs. Clinical symptoms vary widely, but commonly include neurological deficits and increased intracranial pressure. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with its excellent soft tissue contrast, is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring GBM. Emerging techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), provide insights into the tumor's microstructure and vascularity, assisting in the development of therapeutic strategies and response assessment. Despite advances in imaging, challenges remain in accurately diagnosing and managing pediatric GBM due to its molecular heterogeneity and unique biological behavior. New therapeutic approaches, including targeted therapies and immunotherapy, offer hope for improving outcomes in children with GBM. Clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate these treatments alongside standard options, such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, to meet the unmet needs of pediatric oncology. A multidisciplinary approach, tailored to the individual characteristics of both the patient and the tumor, is essential to optimize treatment and outcomes for pediatric GBM patients. This review highlights the role of advanced MRI techniques in diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring, while emphasizing the need for further research and clinical trials to develop more effective therapies for this devastating disease.Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a complex and aggressive brain tumor that presents significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in both adults and children.

Recent studies indicate a me-dian survival rate of 12-18 months for pediatric GBM, with treatment response varying based on molecular subtypes. Clinical trials show that IDH-wild-type tumors exhibit poorer prognosis, whereas targeted therapies are improving outcomes in select patient groups.

### 43. Are Current Survival Prediction Tools Useful When Treating Subsequent Skeletal-related Events From Bone Metastases?
**Authors:** Yu-Ting Pan, Yen-Po Lin, Hung-Kuan Yen, Hung-Ho Yen, Chi-Ching Huang, Hsiang-Chieh Hsieh, Stein Janssen, Ming-Hsiao Hu, Wei-Hsin Lin, Olivier Q Groot

**Abstract:** Bone metastasis in advanced cancer is challenging because of pain, functional issues, and reduced life expectancy. Treatment planning is complex, with consideration of factors such as location, symptoms, and prognosis. Prognostic models help guide treatment choices, with Skeletal Oncology Research Group machine-learning algorithms (SORG-MLAs) showing promise in predicting survival for initial spinal metastases and extremity metastases treated with surgery or radiotherapy. Improved therapies extend patient lifespans, increasing the risk of subsequent skeletal-related events (SREs). Patients experiencing subsequent SREs often suffer from disease progression, indicating a deteriorating condition. For these patients, a thorough evaluation, including accurate survival prediction, is essential to determine the most appropriate treatment and avoid aggressive surgical treatment for patients with a poor survival likelihood. Patients experiencing subsequent SREs often suffer from disease progression, indicating a deteriorating condition. However, some variables in the SORG prediction model, such as tumor histology, visceral metastasis, and previous systemic therapies, might remain consistent between initial and subsequent SREs. Given the prognostic difference between patients with and without a subsequent SRE, the efficacy of established prognostic models-originally designed for individuals with an initial SRE-in addressing a subsequent SRE remains uncertain. Therefore, it is crucial to verify the model's utility for subsequent SREs. We aimed to evaluate the reliability of the SORG-MLAs for survival prediction in patients undergoing surgery or radiotherapy for a subsequent SRE for whom both the initial and subsequent SREs occurred in the spine or extremities. We retrospectively included 738 patients who were 20 years or older who received surgery or radiotherapy for initial and subsequent SREs at a tertiary referral center and local hospital in Taiwan between 2010 and 2019. We excluded 74 patients whose initial SRE was in the spine and in whom the subsequent SRE occurred in the extremities and 37 patients whose initial SRE was in the extremities and the subsequent SRE was in the spine. The rationale was that different SORG-MLAs were exclusively designed for patients who had an initial spine metastasis and those who had an initial extremity metastasis, irrespective of whether they experienced metastatic events in other areas (for example, a patient experiencing an extremity SRE before his or her spinal SRE would also be regarded as a candidate for an initial spinal SRE). Because these patients were already validated in previous studies, we excluded them in case we overestimated our result. Five patients with malignant primary bone tumors and 38 patients in whom the metastasis's origin could not be identified were excluded, leaving 584 patients for analysis. The 584 included patients were categorized into two subgroups based on the location of initial and subsequent SREs: the spine group (68% [399]) and extremity group (32% [185]). No patients were lost to follow-up. Patient data at the time they presented with a subsequent SRE were collected, and survival predictions at this timepoint were calculated using the SORG-MLAs. Multiple imputation with the Missforest technique was conducted five times to impute the missing proportions of each predictor. The effectiveness of SORG-MLAs was gauged through several statistical measures, including discrimination (measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]), calibration, overall performance (Brier score), and decision curve analysis. Discrimination refers to the model's ability to differentiate between those with the event and those without the event. An AUC ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, with 0.5 indicating the worst discrimination and 1.0 indicating perfect discrimination. An AUC of 0.7 is considered clinically acceptable discrimination. Calibration is the comparison between the frequency of observed events and the predicted probabilities. In an ideal calibration, the observed and predicted survival rates should be congruent. The logarithm of observed-to-expected survival ratio [log(O:E)] offers insight into the model's overall calibration by considering the total number of observed (O) and expected (E) events. The Brier score measures the mean squared difference between the predicted probability of possible outcomes for each individual and the observed outcomes, ranging from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating perfect overall performance and 1 indicating the worst performance. Moreover, the prevalence of the outcome should be considered, so a null-model Brier score was also calculated by assigning a probability equal to the prevalence of the outcome (in this case, the actual survival rate) to each patient. The benefit of the prediction model is determined by comparing its Brier score with that of the null model. If a prediction model's Brier score is lower than the null model's Brier score, the prediction model is deemed as having good performance. A decision curve analysis was performed for models to evaluate the "net benefit," which weighs the true positive rate over the false positive rate against the "threshold probabilities," the ratio of risk over benefit after an intervention was derived based on a comprehensive clinical evaluation and a well-discussed shared-decision process. A good predictive model should yield a higher net benefit than default strategies (treating all patients and treating no patients) across a range of threshold probabilities. For the spine group, the algorithms displayed acceptable AUC results (median AUCs of 0.69 to 0.72) for 42-day, 90-day, and 1-year survival predictions after treatment for a subsequent SRE. In contrast, the extremity group showed median AUCs ranging from 0.65 to 0.73 for the corresponding survival periods. All Brier scores were lower than those of their null model, indicating the SORG-MLAs' good overall performances for both cohorts. The SORG-MLAs yielded a net benefit for both cohorts; however, they overestimated 1-year survival probabilities in patients with a subsequent SRE in the spine, with a median log(O:E) of -0.60 (95% confidence interval -0.77 to -0.42). The SORG-MLAs maintain satisfactory discriminatory capacity and offer considerable net benefits through decision curve analysis, indicating their continued viability as prediction tools in this clinical context. However, the algorithms overestimate 1-year survival rates for patients with a subsequent SRE of the spine, warranting consideration of specific patient groups. Clinicians and surgeons should exercise caution when using the SORG-MLAs for survival prediction in these patients and remain aware of potential mispredictions when tailoring treatment plans, with a preference for less invasive treatments. Ultimately, this study emphasizes the importance of enhancing prognostic algorithms and developing innovative tools for patients with subsequent SREs as the life expectancy in patients with bone metastases continues to improve and healthcare providers will encounter these patients more often in daily practice. Level III, prognostic study.

### 44. Allocation Out of Sequence in Lung Transplant: An Analysis of the UNOS Registry.
**Authors:** Samantha E Halpern, Ruby Singh, Oliver K Jawitz, Ahmed Gurses, Isaac S Alderete, Jacob A Klapper, Lucy Nam, Matthew G Hartwig, Asishana A Osho, Kunal J Patel

**Abstract:** Allocation out of sequence (AOOS) allows organ procurement organizations (OPOs) to offer organs outside of standard allocation and bypass those atop the match run. AOOS may allow OPOs to successfully place medically complex organs; however, increasing use of AOOS also raises concern for inefficiencies within the allocation process and may exacerbate systemic inequities. To characterize patterns of lung AOOS among organ procurement organizations and transplant centers and compare lung transplant characteristics and outcomes between in-sequence and AOOS groups. In this retrospective cohort study, the United Network for Organ Sharing registry was queried for lung transplants performed between September 1, 2021, and June 30, 2024. Data were linked to the Potential Transplant Recipient file to identify all offers for included donor lungs. These data were analyzed from October 2024 to February 2025. Participants included adult donors who donated at least 1 lung for transplant and corresponding primary isolated lung transplant recipients. The final cohort included 7914 lung donor-recipient pairs. Lung AOOS vs in sequence, defined by match-run refusal codes for donor lung offers. Donor and recipient characteristics, posttransplant outcomes, and OPO-level and transplant center-level rates of lung AOOS. Overall, 7914 lung transplants were included, of which 558 used AOOS (7.1%). Rates of lung AOOS ranged from 0% to 30% among OPOs and 0% to 50% among transplant centers. Use of lung AOOS increased in the continuous distribution era (10% vs 4%; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). Donors of AOOS lungs were more likely to donate after circulatory death and had lower partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratios, longer ischemic times, and longer travel distances. AOOS recipients were less likely to require pretransplant hospitalization, intensive care, and ventilator or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. On multivariable analysis, lung AOOS was associated with lower odds of prolonged intubation and early acute rejection and shorter posttransplant hospital length of stay. AOOS is increasingly used in lung transplant and is associated with transplant of medically complex lungs into lower acuity recipients. Further investigation is needed to understand how AOOS affects lung utilization, especially in the era of continuous distribution.
