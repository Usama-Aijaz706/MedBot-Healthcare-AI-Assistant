## ðŸ“Œ Executive Summary
For the overall population, cumulative mortality probability estimates were unchanged over successive years of diagnosis for people with both heart failure and atrial fibrillation, while showing small improvements for people initially diagnosed with heart failure only (median reduction in 10-year cumulative probability of 3Â·8% [95% CI 1Â·4-6Â·1] between diagnosis years 2000 and 2008) or atrial fibrillation only (median reduction in 1-year cumulative mortality probability of 2Â·4% [0Â·5-4Â·2] between diagnosis years 2000 and 2017) and improvement over the long-term for people diagnosed with both conditions before age 65 years (median reduction in 10-year cumulative mortality probability of 14Â·5% [95% CI 3Â·8-25Â·2] between diagnosis years 2000 and 2008). One trial showed a reduced number of people developing acute chest syndrome between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those receiving no preoperative transfusions, risk ratio 0.11 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.80) (65 participants), whereas the other trial did not, risk ratio 4.81 (95% confidence interval 0.23 to 99.61) (369 participants).There were no differences between the preoperative transfusion groups and the groups without preoperative transfusion in the number of people developing:â€¢ a vaso-occlusive crisis, Peto odds ratio 1.91 (95% confidence interval 0.61 to 6.04) (two trials, 434 participants, very low quality evidence).â€¢ a serious infection, Peto odds ratio 1.29 (95% confidence interval 0.29 to 5.71) (two trials, 434 participants, very low quality evidence);â€¢ any perioperative complications, risk ratio 0.24 (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 2.05) (one trial, 65 participants, low quality evidence).There was an increase in the number of people developing circulatory overload in those receiving preoperative transfusions compared to those not receiving preoperative transfusions in one of the two trials, and no events were seen in the other trial (no meta-analysis performed). We stratified our primary outcomes according to mode of birth, prior risk of PPH, healthcare setting, dosage, regimen and route of drug administration, to detect subgroup effects.The absolute risks in the oxytocin are based on meta-analyses of proportions from the studies included in this review and the risks in the intervention groups were based on the assumed risk in the oxytocin group and the relative effects of the interventions. Thus, ART used among mothers who require treatment of HIV for their own health also plays a significant role in decreasing MTCT.This review is one in a series of systematic reviews performed in preparation for the revision of the 2006 World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines regarding "Antiretroviral Drugs for Treating Pregnant Women and Preventing HIV Infection in Infants" and "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV Infections in Adults and Adolescents." The findings from these reviews were discussed with experts, key stakeholders, and country representatives at the 2009 WHO guideline review meeting. For retinopathy, intensive glucose control reduced the risk of progression in studies with a follow-up duration of at least two years (85/366 (23.2%) versus 154/398 (38.7%); RR 0.61 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.76); P < 0.0001; 764 participants; 2 trials; moderate quality evidence), while we found evidence for an initial worsening of retinopathy after only one year of intensive glucose control (17/49 (34.7%) versus 7/47 (14.9%); RR 2.32 (95% CI 1.16 to 4.63); P = 0.02; 96 participants; 2 trials; low quality evidence).Major macrovascular outcomes (stroke and myocardial infarction) occurred very rarely, and no firm evidence could be established regarding these outcome measures (low quality evidence).We found that intensive glucose control increased the risk for severe hypoglycaemia, however the results were heterogeneous and only the 'Diabetes Complications Clinical Trial' (DCCT) showed a clear increase in severe hypoglycaemic episodes under intensive treatment. From the patients' perspectives, ways to improve the delivery of exercise interventions included: provide better information and advice about the safety and value of exercise; provide exercise tailored to individual's preferences, abilities and needs; challenge inappropriate health beliefs and provide better support.An integrative review, which compared the findings from quantitative trials with low risk of bias and the implications derived from the high-quality studies in the qualitative synthesis, confirmed the importance of these implications. Overall, the risk of bias in the included studies was low.For the primary outcome overall survival, our analysis demonstrated comparable results between bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) (six studies, 1330 participants; hazard ratio (HR) 1.07; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.25; P value = 0.43; high-quality evidence).Disease-free survival (six studies, 1225 participants; HR 1.04; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.21; P value = 0.6; moderate-quality of evidence) and non-relapse or transplant-related mortality (three studies, 758 participants; HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.28; P = 0.91; high-quality evidence) were also comparable between transplantation arms.In the related-donor setting, data from two of eight studies with 211 participants (21%) indicated a higher relapse incidence in participants transplanted with bone marrow stem cells rather than peripheral blood stem cells (HR 2.73; 95% CI 1.47 to 5.08; P value = 0.001).

**Abstract:** Cardiac allograft vasculopathy remains a major cause of late morbidity following heart transplantation. While accumulating evidence implicates innate macrophages in the inflammatory progression of CAV, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In murine models of CAV, we identified proteolytic cleavage of MERTK, a key anti-inflammatory receptor on macrophages, as a contributing factor to CAV progression. In a model of CAV, MERTK deficiency accelerated allograft rejection and increased intimal leukocyte infiltration. In contrast, mice expressing a genetically cleavage-resistant form of MERTK (Mertk

**Abstract:** Partial heart transplant, or living valve replacement, has the potential to advance surgical management of irreparable valvular disease by providing a viable option with capacity for growth. To describe the early experience and assess the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of partial heart transplant in patients with congenital heart valve disease. Case series of the first 19 patients to undergo partial heart transplant at a single high-volume pediatric cardiac surgery and transplant center in the US between April 2022 and December 2024. No patients were excluded or lost to follow-up. Partial heart transplant using semilunar valves from donor hearts. Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus monotherapy with a trough level goal of 4 to 8 ng/mL. Efficacy was defined as growth of the transplanted valve annulus and leaflets over time. Secondary outcomes included valve dysfunction and complications related to immunosuppression. Among the 19 participants with irreparable congenital heart valve dysfunction, 53% were male and 47% female. The median age at the time of transplant was 97 days. The median follow-up was 26 weeks. Three patients received partial heart transplant of both semilunar valves, 7 underwent living pulmonary valve replacement in the pulmonary position, 2 had a living aortic valve allograft in the aortic position, and 7 had a living aortic valve allograft in the pulmonary position. Nine patients constituting the initial cohort of partial heart transplant recipients had their annular diameter and valve leaflet length longitudinally analyzed for growth. All valves functioned well and demonstrated growth along appropriate z scores. Annular diameter increased from medians of 7 mm (aortic valve) and 9 mm (pulmonary valve) to 14 mm (aortic valve) and 17 mm (pulmonary valve), respectively. Leaflet length similarly increased from medians of 0.5 mm (aortic valve) and 0.49 mm (pulmonary valve) to 1 mm (aortic valve) and 0.675 mm (pulmonary valve), respectively. One patient required reoperation unrelated to the implanted valve. No significant complications related to immunosuppression were observed. Partial heart transplant appears feasible, safe, and efficacious. All transplanted valves demonstrated growth based on annular and leaflet length measurements. Careful follow-up and monitoring are crucial to support the continued expansion of this novel technique.

### 6. Four decades of heart-lung transplantation: Milestones and outcomes in advanced cardiorespiratory failure.
**Authors:** L Lily Rosenthal, Anna Maria MÃ¼hlbauer, Carola Grinninger, Nikolaus A Haas, Heinrich Netz, Robert Dalla Pozza, JÃ¼rgen HÃ¶rer, Sebastian Michel, R Schramm, D Graetz, Christian Hagl

**Abstract:** Heart-lung transplantation (HLTx) remains a life-saving intervention for patients with end-stage cardiopulmonary failure. We retrospectively analysed long-term HLTx outcomes at our centre to assess survival trends and evaluate the impact of evolving immunosuppressive, surgical and perioperative strategies. This single-centre retrospective cohort study included 80 patients who underwent HLTx between 1983-1995 (Era 1) and 1996-2010 (Era 2), with follow-up through June 2024. All patients had severe cardiorespiratory failure. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included early and late post-transplant outcomes. Overall survival at 1, 5 and 10Â years post-transplant was 60Â Â±Â 6%, 46Â Â±Â 6% and 35Â Â±Â 6%, respectively. Survival improved significantly between Era 1 (46Â Â±Â 10%, 18Â Â±Â 9% and 9Â Â±Â 6%) and Era 2 (66Â Â±Â 7%, 5Â Â±Â 7% and 45Â Â±Â 7%) (PÂ <Â 0.001), correlating with advancements in immunosuppression, organ preservation and perioperative care. Univariable risk factors for increased mortality included Euro Collins versus Perfadex lung preservation (PÂ <Â 0.001), University of Wisconsin (UW2) versus Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate (HTK) solution cardioplegia (PÂ <Â 0.001), and Epstein-Barr virus infection (PÂ =Â 0.036). Heart failure: OR 4.557 (95% CI: 1.057-19.648, PÂ =Â 0.042) and gastrointestinal bleeding: OR 2.739 (95% CI: 1.310-5.726, PÂ =Â 0.016) were identified as risks for mortality. These factors remained significant in multivariable analysis. HLTx outcomes at our centre are consistent with international benchmarks. Survival has improved in Era 2, likely due to individualised immunosuppressive regimens, novel organ preservation techniques and enhanced surveillance. These results support ongoing optimisation of multidisciplinary care for complex cardiopulmonary failure.

### 7. Semiparametric Regression Analysis of Interval-Censored Multi-State Data with An Absorbing State.
**Authors:** Yu Gu, Donglin Zeng, D Y Lin

**Abstract:** In studies of chronic diseases, the health status of a subject can often be characterized by a finite number of transient disease states and an absorbing state, such as death. The times of transitions among the transient states are ascertained through periodic examinations and thus interval-censored. The time of reaching the absorbing state is known or right-censored, with the transient state at the previous instant being unobserved. In this paper, we provide a general framework for analyzing such multi-state data. We formulate the effects of potentially time-dependent covariates on the multi-state disease process through semiparametric proportional intensity models with random effects. We combine nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation with sieve estimation and develop a stable expectation-maximization algorithm. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators through novel use of modern empirical process theory, sieve estimation theory, and semiparametric efficiency theory. In addition, we dynamically predict future states and survival time using the evolving disease history. Finally, we assess the performance of the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and provide an illustration with a cardiac allograft vasculopathy study.

**Abstract:** Little is known regarding the travel practices of thoracic organ transplant recipients and their potential associated morbidity. A questionnaire was distributed to thoracic organ transplant recipients to capture demographics, risk perception, knowledge regarding vaccination, history of travel outside metropolitan France, pre-travel advice, health issues during travel outside Europe, and travel intentions in the following year. Comparisons were performed between travelers and non-travelers through univariable then multivariable logistic regression. 134 patients completed the survey (72% lung, 11% heart, and 17% heart-lung transplant recipients). Twenty-four percent considered themselves at moderately to significantly increased risk of travel-related health issues. Sixty-two patients (47%) had traveled outside metropolitan France. Among 29 subjects who had traveled outside Europe, 22 had received pre-travel advice. Among 62 respondents who had traveled outside metropolitan France, 6 (10%) experienced health issues (all outside Europe), which led to consultation in three cases and hospitalization in one case. Among 117 respondents, 68 (58%) intended to travel within the following year, and 57 (84%) to seek medical advice before departure, predominantly from their transplant physician. In multivariable analysis, being a lung transplant recipient and higher education level were associated with travel outside Europe. The time post-transplantation was longer for all types of travel, when compared to non-travelers. Almost half of adult thoracic transplant recipients had traveled outside metropolitan France, 22% outside Europe, and 10% of travelers experienced health issues. The suboptimal preparation of these patients underlines the potential benefits of closer interaction between travel medicine specialists and transplant physicians.

### 9. Continuous intravenous perioperative lidocaine infusion for postoperative pain and recovery in adults.
**Authors:** Stephanie Weibel, Yvonne Jelting, Nathan L Pace, Antonia Helf, Leopold Hj Eberhart, Klaus Hahnenkamp, Markus W Hollmann, Daniel M Poepping, Alexander Schnabel, Peter Kranke

**Abstract:** The management of postoperative pain and recovery is still unsatisfactory in a number of cases in clinical practice. Opioids used for postoperative analgesia are frequently associated with adverse effects, including nausea and constipation, preventing smooth postoperative recovery. Not all patients are suitable for, and benefit from, epidural analgesia that is used to improve postoperative recovery. The non-opioid, lidocaine, was investigated in several studies for its use in multimodal management strategies to reduce postoperative pain and enhance recovery. This review was published in 2015 and updated in January 2017. To assess the effects (benefits and risks) of perioperative intravenous (IV) lidocaine infusion compared to placebo/no treatment or compared to epidural analgesia on postoperative pain and recovery in adults undergoing various surgical procedures. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and reference lists of articles in January 2017. We searched one trial registry contacted researchers in the field, and handsearched journals and congress proceedings. We updated this search in February 2018, but have not yet incorporated these results into the review. We included randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of continuous perioperative IV lidocaine infusion either with placebo, or no treatment, or with thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) in adults undergoing elective or urgent surgery under general anaesthesia. The IV lidocaine infusion must have been started intraoperatively, prior to incision, and continued at least until the end of surgery. We used Cochrane's standard methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were: pain score at rest; gastrointestinal recovery and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included: postoperative nausea and postoperative opioid consumption. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome. We included 23 new trials in the update. In total, the review included 68 trials (4525 randomized participants). Two trials compared IV lidocaine with TEA. In all remaining trials, placebo or no treatment was used as a comparator. Trials involved participants undergoing open abdominal (22), laparoscopic abdominal (20), or various other surgical procedures (26). The application scheme of systemic lidocaine strongly varies between the studies related to both dose (1 mg/kg/h to 5 mg/kg/h) and termination of the infusion (from the end of surgery until several days after).The risk of bias was low with respect to selection bias (random sequence generation), performance bias, attrition bias, and detection bias in more than 50% of the included studies. For allocation concealment and selective reporting, the quality assessment yielded low risk of bias for only approximately 20% of the included studies.IV Lidocaine compared to placebo or no treatment We are uncertain whether IV lidocaine improves postoperative pain compared to placebo or no treatment at early time points (1 to 4 hours) (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.72 to -0.28; 29 studies, 1656 participants; very low-quality evidence) after surgery. Due to variation in the standard deviation (SD) in the studies, this would equate to an average pain reduction of between 0.37 cm and 2.48 cm on a 0 to 10 cm visual analogue scale . Assuming approximately 1 cm on a 0 to 10 cm pain scale is clinically meaningful, we ruled out a clinically relevant reduction in pain with lidocaine at intermediate (24 hours) (SMD -0.14, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.04; 33 studies, 1847 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and at late time points (48 hours) (SMD -0.11, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.04; 24 studies, 1404 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Due to variation in the SD in the studies, this would equate to an average pain reduction of between 0.10 cm to 0.48 cm at 24 hours and 0.08 cm to 0.42 cm at 48 hours. In contrast to the original review in 2015, we did not find any significant subgroup differences for different surgical procedures.We are uncertain whether lidocaine reduces the risk of ileus (risk ratio (RR) 0.37, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.87; 4 studies, 273 participants), time to first defaecation/bowel movement (mean difference (MD) -7.92 hours, 95% CI -12.71 to -3.13; 12 studies, 684 participants), risk of postoperative nausea (overall, i.e. 0 up to 72 hours) (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.91; 35 studies, 1903 participants), and opioid consumption (overall) (MD -4.52 mg morphine equivalents , 95% CI -6.25 to -2.79; 40 studies, 2201 participants); quality of evidence was very low for all these outcomes.The effect of IV lidocaine on adverse effects compared to placebo treatment is uncertain, as only a small number of studies systematically analysed the occurrence of adverse effects (very low-quality evidence).IV Lidocaine compared to TEAThe effects of IV lidocaine compared with TEA are unclear (pain at 24 hours (MD 1.51, 95% CI -0.29 to 3.32; 2 studies, 102 participants), pain at 48 hours (MD 0.98, 95% CI -1.19 to 3.16; 2 studies, 102 participants), time to first bowel movement (MD -1.66, 95% CI -10.88 to 7.56; 2 studies, 102 participants); all very low-quality evidence). The risk for ileus and for postoperative nausea (overall) is also unclear, as only one small trial assessed these outcomes (very low-quality evidence). No trial assessed the outcomes, 'pain at early time points' and 'opioid consumption (overall)'. The effect of IV lidocaine on adverse effects compared to TEA is uncertain (very low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether IV perioperative lidocaine, when compared to placebo or no treatment, has a beneficial impact on pain scores in the early postoperative phase, and on gastrointestinal recovery, postoperative nausea, and opioid consumption. The quality of evidence was limited due to inconsistency, imprecision, and study quality. Lidocaine probably has no clinically relevant effect on pain scores later than 24 hours. Few studies have systematically assessed the incidence of adverse effects. There is a lack of evidence about the effects of IV lidocaine compared with epidural anaesthesia in terms of the optimal dose and timing (including the duration) of the administration. We identified three ongoing studies, and 18 studies are awaiting classification; the results of the review may change when these studies are published and included in the review.

### 10. A pharmacist-led intervention to improve kidney transplant recipient outcomes and identify patients at risk of highly variable trough tacrolimus levels: a cohort study.
**Authors:** Roxane Lhermitte, Brendan Le DarÃ©, Florian Laval, Florian Lemaitre, Barbara Troussier, Marie-Pascale Morin, CÃ©cile Vigneau, Jonathan M Chemouny, Astrid Bacle

**Abstract:** Given the positive impact of appropriate medication management on graft outcome and therefore of patient survival and graft function, the pharmacist's role in the kidney transplantation team has evolved over recent decades. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether pharmacist-led intervention after kidney transplantation is associated with a lower graft rejection rate and intra-patient variation in tacrolimus trough concentrations (C We retrospectively analysed kidney transplant recipients at Rennes University Hospital (France) between January 2013 and December 2020. Patients who received pharmacist-led education (intervention group, n=139) were compared with patients who did not (control group, n=131), according to graft survival at 1â€‰year post-transplant, coefficient of variation (%CV) for the tacrolimus C In the intervention group, 1â€‰year post-transplant graft survival was higher (95.7% vs 88.5%, p=0.0289) and patients had fewer variabilities in C Pharmacist-led interventions may have contributed to improved graft survival and patient management of immunosuppressants. Because %CV correlates with the patient questionnaire score, its introduction could be useful in identifying kidney transplant patients who would benefit most from a pharmacist-led patient education.

### 11. Late (> 7 days) postnatal corticosteroids for chronic lung disease in preterm infants.
**Authors:** Lex W Doyle, Richard A Ehrenkranz, Henry L Halliday

**Abstract:** Many preterm infants who survive go on to develop chronic lung disease. This is probably due to persistent inflammation in the lungs. Corticosteroids have powerful anti-inflammatory effects and have been used to treat established chronic lung disease. However, it is unclear whether any beneficial effects outweigh the adverse effects of these drugs. To determine the relative benefits and adverse effects associated with late (> 7 days) postnatal systemic corticosteroid treatment compared with control (placebo or nothing) in the preterm infant with evolving or established chronic lung disease. We sought randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of postnatal corticosteroid therapy from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1966 through August 2013), handsearching paediatric and perinatal journals, and by examining previous review articles and information received from practising neonatologists. When possible, we contacted authors of all studies to confirm details of reported follow-up studies or to obtain any information about long-term follow-up where none had been reported. We selected RCTs of postnatal corticosteroid treatment initiated after seven days after birth in preterm infants with evolving or established chronic lung disease for this review. We extracted and analysed data regarding clinical outcomes including mortality, chronic lung disease, death or chronic lung disease, failure to extubate, complications in the primary hospitalisation, and long-term health outcomes Twenty-one RCTs enrolling a total of 1424 participants were eligible for this review. All were randomised controlled trials, but the methods for random allocation were not always clear. Allocation concealment, blinding of the intervention and blinding of the outcome assessments were mostly satisfactory. Late steroid treatment was associated with a reduction in neonatal mortality (at 28 days), but not mortality at discharge or latest reported age. Benefits of delayed steroid treatment included reductions in failure to extubate by three, seven or 28 days, chronic lung disease at both 28 days and 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, need for late rescue treatment with dexamethasone, discharge on home oxygen, and death or chronic lung disease at both 28 days and 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. There was a trend towards an increase in risk of infection and gastrointestinal bleeding, but not necrotising enterocolitis. Short-term adverse affects included hyperglycaemia, glycosuria and hypertension. There was an increase in severe retinopathy of prematurity, but no significant increase in blindness. There was a trend towards a reduction in severe intraventricular haemorrhage, but only 247 infants were enrolled in five studies reporting this outcome. The trends to an increase in cerebral palsy or abnormal neurological examination were partly offset by a trend in the opposite direction in death before late follow-up. The combined rate of death or cerebral palsy was not significantly different between steroid and control groups. Major neurosensory disability, and the combined rate of death or major neurosensory disability, were not significantly different between steroid and control groups. There were no substantial differences between groups for other outcomes in later childhood, including respiratory health or function, blood pressure or growth, although there were fewer with a clinically important reduction in the forced expired volume in one second (FEV1) on respiratory function testing. The benefits of late corticosteroid therapy may not outweigh actual or potential adverse effects. Although there continues to be concern about an increased incidence of adverse neurological outcomes in infants treated with postnatal steroids, this review of postnatal corticosteroid treatment for chronic lung disease initiated after seven days of age suggests that late therapy may reduce neonatal mortality without significantly increasing the risk of adverse long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, the methodological quality of the studies determining the long-term outcome is limited in some cases; in some studies the surviving children have only been assessed before school age, when some important neurological outcomes cannot be determined with certainty, and no study was sufficiently powered to detect increased rates of important adverse long-term neurosensory outcomes. Given the evidence of both benefits and harms of treatment, and the limitations of the evidence at present, it appears prudent to reserve the use of late corticosteroids for infants who cannot be weaned from mechanical ventilation and to minimise the dose and duration of any course of treatment.

### 12. Do Women and Minority Orthopaedic Residents Report Experiencing Worse Well-being and More Mistreatment Than Their Peers?
**Authors:** Katherine M Gerull, Sandra E Klein, Anna N Miller, Cara A Cipriano

**Abstract:** Despite the increased risk of attrition for women and minority residents during orthopaedic residency, there is currently a paucity of research examining the training environment of these residents. To address this, we examined how well-being constructs may differ for women or minority residents compared with their peers, and whether these residents report experiencing more mistreatment during residency. (1) How does the psychologic wellbeing of women and minority residents compare with that of their peers regarding the constructs of burnout, lifestyle satisfaction, social belonging, and stereotype threat? (2) Do reported mistreatment experiences during residency differ among women and minority residents compared with their peers? (3) Is there a difference in the proportion of women and minority orthopaedic residents with thoughts of leaving residency compared with their peers? Seventeen orthopaedic residency programs in the 91 programs comprising the Collaborative Orthopaedic Educational Research Group agreed to participate in the study. Program directors sent an anonymous one-time survey with two reminders to all orthopaedic residents at their respective institutions. The survey instrument comprised validated and previously used instruments with face validity designed to measure burnout, satisfaction, duty-hour violations, belonging, stereotype threat, mistreatment, and thoughts of leaving residency, in addition to demographic information. Forty-three percent (211 of 491) of residents responded to the survey. Race or ethnicity data were combined into "White" and "underrepresented in orthopaedics" (URiO), which included residents who self-identified as Asian, African American, Hispanic or Latino, Native American, or other, given that these groups are all underrepresented racial and ethnic groups in orthopaedics. The demographic makeup of our study, 81% men and 75% White, is roughly comparable to the current demographic makeup of orthopaedic residency programs, which is 82% men and 74% White. Data were analyzed using chi-square tests, Fisher exact tests, and t-tests as appropriate. For comparisons of Likert scale measures, we used an anchor-based approach to determining the minimum detectable change (MDC) and set the MDC as a 1-point difference on a 5-point scale and a 1.5-point difference on a 7-point scale. Stereotype threat is reported as the mean â–µ from the neutral response, and â–µ of 1.5 or greater was considered significant. Women residents were more likely than men to report experiencing emotional exhaustion (odds ratio 2.18 [95% confidence interval 1.1 to 4.5]; p = 0.03). Women reported experiencing stereotype threat regarding their identity as women surgeons (mean â–µ 1.5 Â± 1.0). We did not identify a difference in men's and women's overall burnout (OR 1.4 [95% CI 0.7 to 3.0]; p = 0.3), lifestyle satisfaction across multiple domains, or sense of social belonging (men: 4.3, women 3.6; mean difference 0.7 [95% CI 0.4 to 0.9]; p < 0.001). We did not identify differences in overall burnout (OR 1.5 [95% CI 0.8 to 3.0]; p = 0.2), lifestyle satisfaction across multiple domains, sense of social belonging (White: 4.2, URiO: 3.9; mean difference 0.3 [95% CI 0.17 to 0.61]; p < 0.001), or stereotype threat (mean â–µ 0.8 Â± 0.9) between White and URiO surgeons. Women were more likely than men to report experiencing mistreatment, with 84% (32 of 38) of women and 43% (70 of 164) of men reporting mistreatment at least a few times per year (OR 7.2 [95% CI 2.8 to 18.1]; p < 0.001). URiO residents were more likely than White residents to report experiencing mistreatment overall, with 65% (32 of 49) of URiO residents and 45% (66 of 148) of White residents reporting occurrences at least a few times per year (OR 2.3 [95% CI 1.2 to 4.6]; p = 0.01). Women were more likely than men to report experiencing gender discrimination (OR 52.6 [95% CI 18.9 to 146.1]; p < 0.001), discrimination based on pregnancy or childcare status (OR 4.3 [95% CI 1.4 to 12.8]; p = 0.005), and sexual harassment (OR 11.8 [95% CI 4.1 to 34.3]; p < 0.001). URiO residents were more likely than White residents to report experiencing racial discrimination (OR 7.8 [95% CI 3.4 to 18.2]; p < 0.001). More women than men had thoughts of leaving residency (OR 4.5 [95% CI 1.5 to 13.5]; p = 0.003), whereas URiO residents were not more likely to have thoughts of leaving than White residents (OR 2.2 [95% CI 0.7 to 6.6]; p = 0.1). Although we did not detect meaningful differences in some measures of well-being, we identified that women report experiencing more emotional exhaustion and report stereotype threat regarding their identity as women surgeons. Women and URiO residents report more mistreatment than their peers, and women have more thoughts of leaving residency than men. These findings raise concern about some aspects of the training environment for women and URiO residents that could contribute to attrition during training. Understanding how well-being and mistreatment affect underrepresented residents helps in developing strategies to better support women and URiO residents during training. We recommend that orthopaedic governing bodies consider gathering national data on resident well-being and mistreatment to identify specific issues and track data over time. Additionally, departments should examine their internal practices and organizational culture to address specific gaps in inclusivity, well-being, and mechanisms for resident support.

### 13. Pulmonary artery perfusion versus no perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass for open heart surgery in adults.
**Authors:** Katrine B Buggeskov, Lars GrÃ¸nlykke, Emilie C Risom, Mao Ling Wei, JÃ¸rn Wetterslev

**Abstract:** Available evidence has been inconclusive on whether pulmonary artery perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is associated with decreased or increased mortality, pulmonary events, and serious adverse events (SAEs) after open heart surgery. To our knowledge, no previous systematic reviews have included meta-analyses of these interventions. To assess the benefits and harms of single-shot or continuous pulmonary artery perfusion with blood (oxygenated or deoxygenated) or a preservation solution compared with no perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in terms of mortality, pulmonary events, serious adverse events (SAEs), and increased inflammatory markers for adult surgical patients. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, and advanced Google for relevant studies. We handsearched retrieved study reports and scanned citations of included studies and relevant reviews to ensure that no relevant trials were missed. We searched for ongoing trials and unpublished trials in the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and at clinicaltrials.gov (4 July 2017). We contacted medicinal firms producing preservation solutions to retrieve additional studies conducted to examine relevant interventions. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared pulmonary artery perfusion versus no perfusion during CPB in adult patients (â‰§ 18 years). Two independent review authors extracted data, conducted fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analyses, and calculated risk ratios (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous data, we have presented mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as estimates of the intervention effect. To minimize the risk of systematic error, we assessed risk of bias of included trials. To reduce the risk of random errors caused by sparse data and repetitive updating of cumulative meta-analyses, we applied Trial Sequential Analyses (TSAs). We used GRADE principles to assess the quality of evidence. We included in this review four RCTs (210 participants) reporting relevant outcomes. Investigators randomly assigned participants to pulmonary artery perfusion with blood versus no perfusion during CPB. Only one trial included the pulmonary artery perfusion intervention with a preservation solution; therefore we did not perform meta-analysis. Likewise, only one trial reported patient-specific data for the outcome "pulmonary events"; therefore we have provided no results from meta-analysis. Instead, review authors added two explorative secondary outcomes for this version of the review: the ratio of partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO The effects of pulmonary artery perfusion with blood during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) are uncertain owing to the small numbers of participants included in meta-analyses. Risks of death and serious adverse events may be higher with pulmonary artery perfusion with blood during CPB, and robust evidence for any beneficial effects is lacking. Future randomized controlled trials (RCTs) should provide long-term follow-up and patient stratification by preoperative lung function and other documented risk factors for mortality. One study that is awaiting classification (epub abstract with preliminary results) may change the results of this review when full study details have been published.

### 14. Improved health perception after genetic counselling for women at high risk of breast and/or ovarian cancer: construction of new questionnaires--an Italian exploratory study.
**Authors:** Chiara Catania, Irene Feroce, Monica Barile, Aron Goldhirsch, Tommaso De Pas, Filippo de Braud, Sabrina Boselli, Laura Adamoli, Davide Radice, Alessandra Rossi, Gianluca Spitaleri, Cristina Noberasco, Bernardo Bonanni

**Abstract:** Subjects referred to genetic counselling for cancer may have heightened perceptions of illness and death, even though they are healthy and this may cause anxiety and reluctance to follow through with consultation. We investigated such perceptions before and after counselling and genetic testing for cancer in a cohort of Italian women. We sought to understand the situation of the women referred by designing questionnaires administered to women at high risk of breast and/or ovarian cancer (those who had had a pathogenic mutation identified in a family member via diagnostic testing). We also assessed women after the diagnosis of breast cancers, but free of disease, to help determine risks in their families. The first questionnaires were administered before initial counselling, and the second were completed within 20 days after the counselling. When a genetic test was proposed, the individual was asked to fill in a third questionnaire; the final questionnaire was administered after the person had received the results of the genetic test. We evaluated 204 subjects. Before counselling, 89 % of the subjects were worried about their risk of disease, 52 % felt "different" because of their personal and family history, and 39 % declared that their life choices were influenced by their fear of cancer. After counselling, 82 % of the subjects felt more relived about their pre-existing fears and stated that this process of being seen in a clinic with genetic expertise had clarified the meaning of disease risk for them, and for 50 %, this experience had positively influenced their life choices. Thirty percentage of the subjects had a positive test; all of them felt safer in being cared for by specifically trained staff. Fifty percentage had a less informative test (e.g. "wild-type" gene found); 84 % of them were not worried by the uncertainty, and overall, 96 % considered counselling to be very useful. Candidates for genetic counselling frequently had heightened their perception of being ill, which influenced their ability to make life decisions. Genetic counselling often improves this perception, especially in subjects who have negative tests and this knowledge facilitates their life plans. After testing, most women felt satisfied and safer because of being properly followed by professionally trained and sympathetic staff. In conclusion, knowledge of the real individual risk, the presence of a professional team, and the possibility of entering a programme of controlled screening enable patients rather than living in fear and uncertainty to be less anxious about their state of health and to live with the knowledge that they are doing everything possible to care for themselves, aided by a specialized team, and that, if necessary, they would be able to take part in investigational studies.

### 15. Dexrazoxane for preventing or reducing cardiotoxicity in adults and children with cancer receiving anthracyclines.
**Authors:** EsmÃ©e C de Baat, RenÃ©e L Mulder, Saro Armenian, Elizabeth Am Feijen, Heynric Grotenhuis, Melissa M Hudson, Annelies Mc Mavinkurve-Groothuis, Leontien Cm Kremer, Elvira C van Dalen

**Abstract:** This review is the third update of a previously published Cochrane Review. The original review, looking at all possible cardioprotective agents, was split and this part now focuses on dexrazoxane only. Anthracyclines are effective chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of numerous malignancies. Unfortunately, their use is limited by a dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. In an effort to prevent or reduce this cardiotoxicity, different cardioprotective agents have been studied, including dexrazoxane. To assess the efficacy of dexrazoxane to prevent or reduce cardiotoxicity and determine possible effects of dexrazoxane on antitumour efficacy, quality of life and toxicities other than cardiac damage in adults and children with cancer receiving anthracyclines when compared to placebo or no additional treatment. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to May 2021. We also handsearched reference lists, the proceedings of relevant conferences and ongoing trials registers. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which dexrazoxane was compared to no additional therapy or placebo in adults and children with cancer receiving anthracyclines. Two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction, risk of bias and GRADE assessment of included studies. We analysed results in adults and children separately. We performed analyses according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For this update, we identified 548 unique records. We included three additional RCTs: two paediatric and one adult. Therefore, we included a total of 13 eligible RCTs (five paediatric and eight adult). The studies enrolled 1252 children with leukaemia, lymphoma or a solid tumour and 1269 participants, who were mostly diagnosed with breast cancer. In adults, moderate-quality evidence showed that there was less clinical heart failure with the use of dexrazoxane (risk ratio (RR) 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.43; 7 studies, 1221 adults). In children, we identified no difference in clinical heart failure risk between treatment groups (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.19; 3 studies, 885 children; low-quality evidence). In three paediatric studies assessing cardiomyopathy/heart failure as the primary cause of death, none of the children had this outcome (1008 children, low-quality evidence). In the adult studies, different definitions for subclinical myocardial dysfunction and clinical heart failure combined were used, but pooled analyses were possible: there was a benefit in favour of the use of dexrazoxane (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.56; 3 studies, 417 adults and RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.66; 2 studies, 534 adults, respectively, moderate-quality evidence). In the paediatric studies, definitions of subclinical myocardial dysfunction and clinical heart failure combined were incomparable, making pooling impossible. One paediatric study showed a benefit in favour of dexrazoxane (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.85; 33 children; low-quality evidence), whereas another study showed no difference between treatment groups (Fischer exact P = 0.12; 537 children; very low-quality evidence). Overall survival (OS) was reported in adults and overall mortality in children. The meta-analyses of both outcomes showed no difference between treatment groups (hazard ratio (HR) 1.04, 95% 0.88 to 1.23; 4 studies; moderate-quality evidence; and HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.42; 3 studies, 1008 children; low-quality evidence, respectively). Progression-free survival (PFS) was only reported in adults. We subdivided PFS into three analyses based on the comparability of definitions, and identified a longer PFS in favour of dexrazoxane in one study (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.90; 164 adults; low-quality evidence). There was no difference between treatment groups in the other two analyses (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.40; 1 study; low-quality evidence; and HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.43; 2 studies; moderate-quality evidence, respectively). In adults, there was no difference in tumour response rate between treatment groups (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.04; 6 studies, 956 adults; moderate-quality evidence). We subdivided tumour response rate in children into two analyses based on the comparability of definitions, and identified no difference between treatment groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.07; 1 study, 206 children; very low-quality evidence; and RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01; 1 study, 200 children; low-quality evidence, respectively). The occurrence of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN) was only assessed in children. The available and worst-case analyses were identical and showed a difference in favour of the control group (RR 3.08, 95% CI 1.13 to 8.38; 3 studies, 1015 children; low-quality evidence). In the best-case analysis, the direction of effect was the same, but there was no difference between treatment groups (RR 2.51, 95% CI 0.96 to 6.53; 4 studies, 1220 children; low-quality evidence). For other adverse effects, results also varied. None of the studies evaluated quality of life. If not reported, the number of participants for an analysis was unclear. Our meta-analyses showed the efficacy of dexrazoxane in preventing or reducing cardiotoxicity in adults treated with anthracyclines. In children, there was a difference between treatment groups for one cardiac outcome (i.e. for one of the definitions used for clinical heart failure and subclinical myocardial dysfunction combined) in favour of dexrazoxane. In adults, no evidence of a negative effect on tumour response rate, OS and PFS was identified; and in children, no evidence of a negative effect on tumour response rate and overall mortality was identified. The results for adverse effects varied. In children, dexrazoxane may be associated with a higher risk of SMN; in adults this was not addressed. In adults, the quality of the evidence ranged between moderate and low; in children, it ranged between low and very low. Before definitive conclusions on the use of dexrazoxane can be made, especially in children, more high-quality research is needed. We conclude that if the risk of cardiac damage is expected to be high, it might be justified to use dexrazoxane in children and adults with cancer who are treated with anthracyclines. However, clinicians and patients should weigh the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane against the possible risk of adverse effects, including SMN, for each individual. For children, the International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group has developed a clinical practice guideline.

### 16. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor with or without stem or progenitor cellÂ or growth factors infusion for people with compensated or decompensated advanced chronic liver disease.
**Authors:** Agostino Colli, Mirella Fraquelli, Daniele Prati, Giovanni Casazza

**Abstract:** Advanced chronic liver disease is characterised by a long compensated phase followed by a rapidly progressive 'decompensated' phase, which is marked by the development of complications of portal hypertension and liver dysfunction. Advanced chronic liver disease is considered responsible for more than one million deaths annually worldwide. No treatment is available to specifically target fibrosis and cirrhosis; liver transplantation remains the only curative option. Researchers are investigating strategies to restore liver functionality to avoid or slow progression towards end-stage liver disease. Cytokine mobilisation of stem cells from the bone marrow to the liver could improve liver function. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a 175-amino-acid protein currently available for mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow. Multiple courses of G-CSF, with or without stem or progenitor cell or growth factors (erythropoietin or growth hormone) infusion, might be associated with accelerated hepatic regeneration, improved liver function, and survival. To evaluate the benefits and harms of G-CSF with or without stem or progenitor cell or growth factors (erythropoietin or growth hormone) infusion, compared with no intervention or placebo in people with compensated or decompensated advanced chronic liver disease. We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trial registers (October 2022) together with reference-checking and web-searching to identify additional studies. We applied no restrictions on language and document type. We only included randomised clinical trials comparing G-CSF, independent of the schedule of administration, as a single treatment or combined with stem or progenitor cell infusion, or with other medical co-interventions, with no intervention or placebo, in adults with chronic compensated or decompensated advanced chronic liver disease or acute-on-chronic liver failure. We included trials irrespective of publication type, publication status, outcomes reported, or language. We followed standard Cochrane procedures. All-cause mortality, serious adverse events, and health-related quality of life were our primary outcomes, and liver disease-related morbidity, non-serious adverse events, and no improvement of liver function scores were our secondary outcomes. We undertook meta-analyses, based on intention-to-treat, and presented results using risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and I We included 20 trials (1419 participants; sample size ranged from 28 to 259), which lasted between 11 and 57 months. Nineteen trials included only participants with decompensated cirrhosis; in one trial, 30% had compensated cirrhosis. The included trials were conducted in Asia (15), Europe (four), and the USA (one). Not all trials provided data for our outcomes. All trials reported data allowing intention-to-treat analyses. The experimental intervention consisted of G-CSF alone or G-CSF plus any of the following: growth hormone, erythropoietin, N-acetyl cysteine, infusion of CD133-positive haemopoietic stem cells, or infusion of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells. The control group consisted of no intervention in 15 trials and placebo (normal saline) in five trials. Standard medical therapy (antivirals, alcohol abstinence, nutrition, diuretics, Î²-blockers, selective intestinal decontamination, pentoxifylline, prednisolone, and other supportive measures depending on the clinical status and requirement) was administered equally to the trial groups. Very low-certainty evidence suggested a decrease in mortality with G-CSF, administered alone or in combination with any of the above, versus placebo (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.72; I G-CSF, alone or in combination, seems to decrease mortality in people with decompensated advanced chronic liver disease of whatever aetiology and with or without acute-on-chronic liver failure, but the certainty of evidence is very low because of high risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. The results of trials conducted in Asia and Europe were discrepant; this could not be explained by differences in participant selection, intervention, and outcome measurement. Data on serious adverse events and health-related quality of life were few and inconsistently reported. The evidence is also very uncertain regarding the occurrence of one or more liver disease-related complications. We lack high-quality, global randomised clinical trials assessing the effect of G-CSF on clinically relevant outcomes.

### 17. Impact of antiviral prophylaxis on EBV viremia and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders in solid organ transplant recipients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
**Authors:** Marjan Moghadamnia, Khadijeh Delroba, Shima Heidari, Zahra Rezaie, Simin Dashti-Khavidaki

**Abstract:** Organ transplant recipients face a substantial risk of developing posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD). In over 90% of cases with B-cell PTLD following solid organ transplantation, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome is promptly identified, usually within the initial year. A continuing discussion revolves around the efficacy of antiviral prophylaxis in mitigating the incidence of PTLD in solid organ transplant (SOT) patients. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate this issue. A comprehensive search was conducted up to December 31, 2023, in databases including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for retrospective and prospective studies comparing antiviral prophylaxis effects on EVB viremia and PTLD incidence in SOT recipients. Fixed or random effect models were applied based on the heterogeneity assessed via the I In total, 22 eligible studies involving 13,498 patients were analyzed. Antiviral prophylaxis was associated with a significant reduction in EBV viremia incidence in SOT recipients, as demonstrated in 10 studies (relative risk (RR) 0.69, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.88). The rate of PTLD was significantly lower among those who received antiviral prophylaxis compared to those who did not, as reported in 18 studies (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.94). No significant difference was observed in the subgroup of high-risk recipients based on EBV serology (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.78). Additionally, a notable reduction in PTLD incidence was seen in the pediatric subgroup (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.79) using antiviral prophylaxis, while no significant differences were observed in the subgroup of adults (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.21). Administration of antiviral prophylaxis can significantly reduce the incidence of PTLD among kidney (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.87) and heart transplant patients (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.96). PTLD incidence was significantly reduced among recipients of T-cell depletion or steroid-based immunosuppression using antiviral prophylaxis (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.39-0.74 and RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41-0.73, respectively). This meta-analysis revealed that administering antiviral prophylaxis to patients after solid organ transplantation reduces PTLD and EBV viremia occurrences, especially among pediatric recipients, individuals undergoing kidney or heart transplantation, and those receiving high-intensity immunosuppression regimens. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) and other EBV syndromes are among the most serious complications following solid organ transplantation (SOT), primarily due to the necessity for prolonged immunosuppressive therapy. Among the strategies for preventing EBV-related complications, the use of antiviral prophylaxis is a subject of ongoing debate. This systematic review and meta-analysis found that antiviral prophylaxis significantly reduced EBV viremia incidence (risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.88) compared to those without prophylaxis. In the sub-analysis related to high-risk EBV serologically mismatched SOT recipients (EBV D+/R-), the result did not show a significant difference in terms of PTLD incidence (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.78). Antiviral prophylaxis significantly impacted the occurrence of PTLD events among pediatric SOT patients (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.79), but not among adult patients (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.21). Antiviral prophylaxis significantly impacted the occurrence of PTLD events among kidney/simultaneous pancreas and kidney (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.87) and heart (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.96) transplant patients but not liver Â (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.08) transplant recipients.

### 18. Does Augmenting Irradiated Autografts With Free Vascularized Fibula Graft in Patients With Bone Loss From a Malignant Tumor Achieve Union, Function, and Complication Rate Comparably to Patients Without Bone Loss and Augmentation When Reconstructing Intercalary Resections in the Lower Extremity?
**Authors:** Arman Vahabi, HÃ¼seyin Kaya, BakÄ±t Kerekulov, Ahmet BiÃ§er, BurÃ§in KeÃ§eci, DÃ¼ndar Sabah

**Abstract:** Extracorporeally irradiated autografting is a recognized technique in reconstruction after intercalary resections, but it has drawbacks such as nonunion and graft fracture. Because sterilized autografts lose some of their mechanical properties due to involvement of the cortex with tumor, the curettage, and the adverse effects of irradiation or other sterilization techniques, some have proposed adding vascularized fibula to augment the autograft. Because this potentially adds morbidity, we sought to address the value of adding vascular fibular grafts to reconstruction with irradiated autografts. Comparing patients who received an extracorporeally radiated autograft alone with those who received such a graft augmented by a free vascularized fibular autograft: (1) Was the proportion of patients who did not achieve union by 12 months higher in the group that received the augmented (vascularized) graft? (2) Did the augmented-graft group demonstrate greater survivorship free from graft loss at 72 months than did the group receiving an irradiated graft alone? (3) Were there between-group differences in functional results? (4) Were there between-group differences in complications, defined as those substantial enough to result in further surgery? In our single-center study, conducted in a tertiary academic referral center, we performed a retrospective chart audit of patients undergoing intercalary resections for primary sarcomas of the femur and tibia. Between January 2002 and April 2023, three surgeons (HK, BK, DS) treated 345 patients for bone sarcoma of the femur or tibia. Of those, we considered 25% (85) treated with intercalary resection for primary bone sarcomas as potentially eligible. A further 7% (23 of 345) of patients were excluded because their reconstruction was performed using a technique other than irradiated autografts. Another 2% (6) had died prior to the minimum follow-up period of 24 months, another 1% (3) did not finish the 24-month follow-up, and 1% (3) were lost to follow-up for > 5 years, leaving 14% (50 of 345) for analysis here. Among these, 26% (13 of 50) of patients underwent reconstruction involving an extracorporeally irradiated autograft and augmentation with a vascularized fibula autograft. In the remaining 37 patients, reconstruction was performed using extracorporeally irradiated bone alone. During this period, intercalary resection was typically indicated for patients with primary bone sarcomas located in the metaphyseal or diaphyseal regions without articular involvement, provided that they demonstrated a favorable response to neoadjuvant therapy. In this predominantly young patient cohort, extracorporeally irradiated autografts were our preferred reconstruction method after sarcoma resection. Isolated extracorporeally irradiated autografts were selected for patients with radiologic evidence of adequate bone quality and preserved cortical integrity. In patients who have a tumor with extensive cortical destruction-yet still considered suitable for reconstruction after irradiation-vascularized fibular grafts were added to the irradiated autografts. In the group reconstructed with irradiated autograft alone, 54% (20 of 37) of patients were male and 46% (17) were female, with a median (range) age of 15 years (4 to 60). The diagnoses included osteosarcoma in 51% (19 of 37) of patients and Ewing sarcoma in 32% (12). The tumor was located in the tibia in 59% (22) of patients and in the femur in 41% (15). In the group receiving irradiated autograft augmented with vascularized fibula, 6 of the 13 patients were male and 7 were female, with a median (range) age of 13 years (6 to 40). Diagnoses included osteosarcoma in eight of 13 patients, Ewing sarcoma in four, and malignant mesenchymal tumor in one patient. Tumor originated from the femur in 11 patients and from the tibia in two. The two groups were similar in terms of histopathologic diagnosis, age, gender, follow-up duration, and tumor location within bone while the proportion of tumors originating from the femur was higher in the group treated with vascularized fibula augmentation (85% versus 41%; p < 0.05). Fixation technique and the ratio of the resected bone length to the entire bone were noted using the first postoperative radiograph. Bony union, defined as bony bridging in at least three cortices, was assessed using two-plane radiographs. Patients who achieved bony union within the first 12 months without undergoing any additional surgical intervention were classified as having union. Patients whose autograft incorporation exceeded 12 months but ultimately achieved union before 15 months without the need for additional intervention were classified as having delayed union. Nonunion was defined as when patients demonstrated incomplete integration at the 15-month follow-up or when patients needed additional intervention before healing. The survival of extracorporeally irradiated autografts, free from any degree of loss (partial or complete graft loss attributed to graft fracture resorption or graft removal after infection or recurrence), was assessed using competing risk analysis, with death as a competing event at 72 months postoperatively. Functional outcomes were measured using the 1993 version of the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) scoring system with its six subheadings. Complications were defined as events that were substantial enough to result in surgery. Problems related to fibular donor site were also recorded. In patients who received reconstruction with irradiated autografts alone, graft loss occurred in five patients before union was achieved, and one patient died before 12 months; thus, these patients were excluded from analysis on union within 12 months. Among the remaining 31 patients, union was achieved within 12 months in 71% (22) of patients, delayed union in 16% (5) of patients, and nonunion in 13% (4) of patients. In the group in which vascularized fibula was used to augment the irradiated autograft, union occurred within 12 months in 9 of 13 patients, while delayed union and nonunion were observed in two patients each. There was no difference between the groups (p > 0.99). At 72 months, the cumulative incidence of graft loss was 32% (95% confidence interval [CI] 19.1% to 47.6%) in the irradiated autograft-alone group and 13% (95% CI 2.3% to 40.3%) in the fibula-augmented group. The cumulative incidence of death at 72 months was 25% (95% CI 13.9% to 40.3%) in the irradiated autograft-alone group and 20% (95% CI 5.0% to 48.6%) in the fibula-augmented group. Competing risk regression for graft loss, treating death as a competing event, showed no difference between the groups (subdistribution HR 0.42 [95% CI 0.10 to 1.84]; p = 0.25). The median (range) MSTS score in patients reconstructed with irradiated autograft alone was 27 (18 to 30), while the median (range) MSTS score in those reconstructed with irradiated autograft augmented with vascularized fibula was 24 (20 to 30), and there were no differences between the groups in terms of total MSTS scores or any of the MSTS subdomains. In patients reconstructed with irradiated autograft alone, a total of 28 complications were observed in 20 patients. For those patients, the median (range) time from surgery to complication was 15 months (2 to 72). In patients reconstructed with irradiated autograft augmented with vascularized fibula, a total of nine complications were observed in seven patients. For those patients, the median (range) time from surgery to occurrence of complication was 18 months (1 to 23). There was no difference between the two groups in terms of the proportion of patients who faced complication or the median time to occurrence of complications. A total of four patients experienced donor site-related problems, none of which resulted in further surgery. Despite being applied in tougher lesions with less favorable bone quality, the addition of a vascularized fibula into extracorporeally irradiated autograft for reconstruction of intercalary resections yielded comparable outcomes in terms of bony union, graft survival, functional scores, and complications when compared with patients with more favorable host bone who received reconstruction with irradiated graft alone. Although our numbers were small, given the complexity and additional morbidity associated with vascularized fibular graft, its use might be reserved for selected patients in whom biological reconstruction is desired, but the host bone is deemed weakened and unlikely to be successful compared with those patients with more intact bone. Larger studies comparing this technique with other reconstruction options such as structural allografts, intercalary endoprostheses, or cement-rod constructs are needed to better define its role. We recommend reserving the use of vascularized fibula augmentation as a reinforcement strategy in reconstructions with irradiated autografts after intercalary resections of the femur and tibia, opting for it only when additional benefit is anticipated, given that it prolongs operative time, necessitates the involvement of a reconstructive surgery team, and introduces additional donor-site considerations. Level III, therapeutic study.

### 19. Antibody induction versus placebo, no induction, or another type of antibody induction for liver transplant recipients.
**Authors:** Luit Penninga, AndrÃ© Wettergren, Colin H Wilson, An-Wen Chan, Daniel A SteinbrÃ¼chel, Christian Gluud

**Abstract:** Liver transplantation is an established treatment option for end-stage liver failure. To date, no consensus has been reached on the use of immunosuppressive T-cell antibody induction for preventing rejection after liver transplantation. To assess the benefits and harms of immunosuppressive T-cell specific antibody induction compared with placebo, no induction, or another type of T-cell specific antibody induction for prevention of acute rejection in liver transplant recipients. We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) until September 2013. Randomised clinical trials assessing immunosuppression with T-cell specific antibody induction compared with placebo, no induction, or another type of antibody induction in liver transplant recipients. Our inclusion criteria stated that participants within each included trial should have received the same maintenance immunosuppressive therapy. We planned to include trials with all of the different types of T-cell specific antibodies that are or have been used for induction (ie., polyclonal antibodies (rabbit of horse antithymocyte globulin (ATG), or antilymphocyte globulin (ALG)), monoclonal antibodies (muromonab-CD3, anti-CD2, or alemtuzumab), and interleukin-2 receptor antagonists (daclizumab, basiliximab, BT563, or Lo-Tact-1)). We used RevMan analysis for statistical analysis of dichotomous data with risk ratio (RR) and of continuous data with mean difference (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the risk of systematic errors (bias) using bias risk domains with definitions. We used trial sequential analysis to control for random errors (play of chance). We presented outcome results in a summary of findings table. We included 19 randomised clinical trials with a total of 2067 liver transplant recipients. All 19 trials were with high risk of bias. Of the 19 trials, 16 trials were two-arm trials, and three trials were three-arm trials. Hence, we found 25 trial comparisons with antibody induction agents: interleukin-2 receptor antagonist (IL-2 RA) versus no induction (10 trials with 1454 participants); monoclonal antibody versus no induction (five trials with 398 participants); polyclonal antibody versus no induction (three trials with 145 participants); IL-2 RA versus monoclonal antibody (one trial with 87 participants); and IL-2 RA versus polyclonal antibody (two trials with 112 participants). Thus, we were able to compare T-cell specific antibody induction versus no induction (17 trials with a total of 1955 participants). Overall, no difference in mortality (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.28; low-quality of evidence), graft loss including death (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.19; low-quality of evidence), and adverse events ((RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02; low-quality evidence) outcomes was observed between any kind of T-cell specific antibody induction compared with no induction when the T-cell specific antibody induction agents were analysed together or separately. Acute rejection seemed to be reduced when any kind of T-cell specific antibody induction was compared with no induction (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.96; moderate-quality evidence), and when trial sequential analysis was applied, the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit was crossed before the required information size was obtained. Furthermore, serum creatinine was statistically significantly higher when T-cell specific antibody induction was compared with no induction (MD 3.77 Î¼mol/L, 95% CI 0.33 to 7.21; low-quality evidence), as well as when polyclonal T-cell specific antibody induction was compared with no induction, but this small difference was not clinically significant. We found no statistically significant differences for any of the remaining predefined outcomes - infection, cytomegalovirus infection, hepatitis C recurrence, malignancy, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease, renal failure requiring dialysis, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension - when the T-cell specific antibody induction agents were analysed together or separately. Limited data were available for meta-analysis on drug-specific adverse events such as haematological adverse events for antithymocyte globulin. No data were found on quality of life.When T-cell specific antibody induction agents were compared with another type of antibody induction, no statistically significant differences were found for mortality, graft loss, and acute rejection for the separate analyses. When interleukin-2 receptor antagonists were compared with polyclonal T-cell specific antibody induction, drug-related adverse events were less common among participants treated with interleukin-2 receptor antagonists (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.63; low-quality evidence), but this was caused by the results from one trial, and trial sequential analysis could not exclude random errors. We found no statistically significant differences for any of the remaining predefined outcomes: infection, cytomegalovirus infection, hepatitis C recurrence, malignancy, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease, renal failure requiring dialysis, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. No data were found on quality of life. The effects of T-cell antibody induction remain uncertain because of the high risk of bias of the randomised clinical trials, the small number of randomised clinical trials reported, and the limited numbers of participants and outcomes in the trials. T-cell specific antibody induction seems to reduce acute rejection when compared with no induction. No other clear benefits or harms were associated with the use of any kind of T-cell specific antibody induction compared with no induction, or when compared with another type of T-cell specific antibody. Hence, more randomised clinical trials are needed to assess the benefits and harms of T-cell specific antibody induction compared with placebo, and compared with another type of antibody, for prevention of rejection in liver transplant recipients. Such trials ought to be conducted with low risks of systematic error (bias) and low risk of random error (play of chance).

### 20. What Are the Functional, Radiographic, and Survivorship Outcomes of a Modified Cup-cage Technique for Pelvic Discontinuity?
**Authors:** Wenbo Mu, Boyong Xu, Tuerhongjiang Wahafu, Fei Wang, Wentao Guo, Chen Zou, Li Cao

**Abstract:** Pelvic discontinuity (PD) presents a complex challenge in revision hip arthroplasty. The traditional cup-cage construct, which involves a screw-secured porous metal cup and an overlying antiprotrusio cage, has shown promising mid- to long-term results. However, there is limited information on the outcomes of modifications to the original technique. Our study aims to evaluate a modified technique in which the cup position is determined by the placement of the overlying cage, allowing for adjustments to achieve optimal orientation. Among patients treated for PD with a cup-cage construct in which the cup position was dictated by the position of the cage: (1) What are Harris hip scores achieved at a minimum of 2 years of follow-up? (2) What is the Kaplan-Meier survivorship free from aseptic loosening or component migration? (3) What is the Kaplan-Meier survivorship free from revision for any reason? (4) What surgical complications are associated with the procedure? Between October 2013 and January 2022, we performed 805 acetabular revisions. Among these, 33 patients with PD confirmed intraoperatively were considered potentially eligible for a cup-cage construct; no other method of surgical management was used. We performed 64% (21 of 33) of these procedures from October 2013 to January 2018, with 6% (2 of 33) of patients lost to follow-up before the minimum study follow-up of 2 years; these 19 patients were monitored over a period ranging from 70 to 115 months. A further 12 patients underwent this procedure from January 2018 to January 2022, with one lost to follow-up before the minimum study follow-up of 2 years; the other patients met the minimum 2-year follow-up requirement. The remaining 30 patients with data analyzed here (10 men, 20 women) had a mean Â± SD age of 61 Â± 12 years and a median BMI of 29 kg/m 2 (range 20 to 33 kg/m 2 ) at the time of revision surgery. Twenty-one patients underwent revision due to aseptic loosening, and nine due to periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). The causes of PD in our patients were as follows: cup aseptic loosening without significant osteolysis in 20% (6 of 30), where the loose cup caused erosion of the host bone, leading to PD; PJI in 30% (9 of 30); intraoperative iatrogenic PD in 3% (1 of 30); and osteolysis in 47% (14 of 30), which also resulted in aseptic loosening. The median follow-up time was 79 months (range 25 to 115 months). The Harris hip score was used to evaluate clinical outcomes, with preoperative values compared with the most recent follow-up. Radiographs were reviewed by two experienced surgeons at each follow-up visit to assess component loosening (defined as migration > 5 mm or the presence of circumferential radiolucent lines) or clear migration. PD was considered healed if bridging callus or trabecular bone was visible across the site of the discontinuity. Complications were assessed through a comprehensive review of electronic medical records. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate implant survivorship and radiographic loosening, with aseptic loosening or component migration as the endpoint, as well as survivorship free from any reoperation. The Harris hip score improved from a median of 39 (range 30 to 66) preoperatively to a median of 76 (range 30 to 90) postoperatively (median difference 33 [range 2 to 48]; p < 0.01). Within the limitations of two-dimensional (2D) radiographic imaging, successful bone graft integration and the healing of PD were noted in 83% (25 of 30) of patients. Kaplan-Meier survivorship free from radiographic signs of aseptic loosening or component migration was 100% (95% CI 100% to 100%) at 115 months. When any revision related to the acetabular component was considered the endpoint, survivorship free from acetabular component revision at 115 months after revision surgery was 100% (95% CI 100% to 100%). When the need for any reoperation was considered the endpoint, survivorship free from needing reoperation at 115 months after revision surgery was 85% for all patients (95% CI 73% to 100%). When including only patients with a follow-up time of > 4 years (20 of 30), survivorship free from needing reoperation at 115 months after revision surgery was 90% (95% CI 78% to 100%). Postoperative complications during the follow-up period included one early dislocation on the fifth day after surgery, treated with closed reduction and 6 weeks of abduction bracing. One femoral stem loosening occurred at 56 months postoperatively, although the acetabular component remained securely fixed; this patient declined revision surgery. One patient experienced a dislocation 5 months after surgery but refused treatment and opted for prolonged bed rest. Additionally, one patient underwent a debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention procedure 1 week after the revision surgery and subsequently showed no signs of infection at the latest follow-up, 38 months postoperatively. Our study highlights the effectiveness of a modified cup-cage technique in complex hip revisions, showing promising results in terms of construct survivorship and low complication rates. Surgeons could consider delaying screw fixation until after positioning the cage within the porous cup to allow for optimal adjustment and using metal augments for severe bone defects to achieve better alignment. Surgeon experience with the cup-cage technique is crucial for achieving optimal outcomes. Future studies should focus on long-term follow-up visits to assess the durability and effectiveness of these modifications and explore the comparative effectiveness versus other methods, such as custom triflange components and jumbo cups with distraction. Level III, therapeutic study.

### 21. Mycophenolic acid versus azathioprine as primary immunosuppression for kidney transplant recipients.
**Authors:** Martin Wagner, Amy K Earley, Angela C Webster, Christopher H Schmid, Ethan M Balk, Katrin Uhlig

**Abstract:** Modern immunosuppressive regimens after kidney transplantation usually use a combination of two or three agents of different classes to prevent rejection and maintain graft function. Most frequently, calcineurin-inhibitors (CNI) are combined with corticosteroids and a proliferation-inhibitor, either azathioprine (AZA) or mycophenolic acid (MPA). MPA has largely replaced AZA as a first line agent in primary immunosuppression, as MPA is believed to be of stronger immunosuppressive potency than AZA. However, treatment with MPA is more costly, which calls for a comprehensive assessment of the comparative effects of the two drugs. This review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to look at the benefits and harms of MPA versus AZA in primary immunosuppressive regimens after kidney transplantation. Both agents were compared regarding their efficacy for maintaining graft and patient survival, prevention of acute rejection, maintaining graft function, and their safety, including infections, malignancies and other adverse events. Furthermore, we investigated potential effect modifiers, such as transplantation era and the concomitant immunosuppressive regimen in detail. We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register (to 21 September 2015) through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. All RCTs about MPA versus AZA in primary immunosuppression after kidney transplantation were included, without restriction on language or publication type. Two authors independently determined study eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from each study. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model and the results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We included 23 studies (94 reports) that involved 3301 participants. All studies tested mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an MPA, and 22 studies reported at least one outcome relevant for this review. Assessment of methodological quality indicated that important information on factors used to judge susceptibility for bias was infrequently and inconsistently reported.MMF treatment reduced the risk for graft loss including death (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.0) and for death-censored graft loss (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.99, P < 0.05). No statistically significant difference for MMF versus AZA treatment was found for all-cause mortality (16 studies, 2987 participants: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.29). The risk for any acute rejection (22 studies, 3301 participants: RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.73, P < 0.01), biopsy-proven acute rejection (12 studies, 2696 participants: RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.68) and antibody-treated acute rejection (15 studies, 2914 participants: RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.65, P < 0.01) were reduced in MMF treated patients. Meta-regression analyses suggested that the magnitude of risk reduction of acute rejection may be dependent on the control rate (relative risk reduction (RRR) 0.34, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.09, P = 0.08), AZA dose (RRR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.01, P = 0.10) and the use of cyclosporin A micro-emulsion (RRR 1.27, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.65, P = 0.07). Pooled analyses failed to show a significant and meaningful difference between MMF and AZA in kidney function measures.Data on malignancies and infections were sparse, except for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. The risk for CMV viraemia/syndrome (13 studies, 2880 participants: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.32) was not statistically significantly different between MMF and AZA treated patients, whereas the likelihood of tissue-invasive CMV disease was greater with MMF therapy (7 studies, 1510 participants: RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.61). Adverse event profiles varied: gastrointestinal symptoms were more likely in MMF treated patients and thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes were more common in AZA treatment. MMF was superior to AZA for improvement of graft survival and prevention of acute rejection after kidney transplantation. These benefits must be weighed against potential harms such as tissue-invasive CMV disease. However, assessment of the evidence on safety outcomes was limited due to rare events in the observation periods of the studies (e.g. malignancies) and inconsistent reporting and definitions (e.g. infections, adverse events). Thus, balancing benefits and harms of the two drugs remains a major task of the transplant physician to decide which agent the individual patient should be started on.

### 22. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor plus endothelin receptor antagonist compared to either alone for group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension.
**Authors:** Yuji Oba, Tinashe Maduke, Eddie W Fakhouri, Yohannes Goite

**Abstract:** Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a rare disorder, causes elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to heart failure. Untreated PAH has a poor prognosis, emphasising the need for effective intervention. Pharmacological treatment includes pulmonary vasodilators such as endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA), prostacyclin analogues, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i), and soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators, often used together to improve symptoms and quality of life while reducing mortality and risk of hospitalisation. To assess the benefits and harms of combination therapy involving a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i) and an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) in adults and adolescents with group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) compared to either agent alone. We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The most recent searches were conducted on 13 March 2024. We included published and unpublished RCTs comparing combinations of ERAs and PDE5is versus either agent alone lasting at least 12 weeks. Participants were aged 12 years or older with WHO group 1 PAH meeting specific haemodynamic criteria. We excluded cluster-, cross-over, and quasi-RCTs, and other PAH-specific medications. Critical outcomes were clinical worsening, mortality, and hospitalisation. Important outcomes were changes in six-minute walk distance (6MWD), WHO functional class, Borg Dyspnea Scale, serious adverse events, and withdrawal from the trial. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We resolved disagreements through discussion or consultation. This informed GRADE ratings and summary of findings tables. We used a random-effects model to address study differences, switching to a fixed-effect model if there was variation primarily due to random error. We conducted meta-analyses if deemed meaningful, with data pooled if treatments, participants, and clinical questions were sufficiently similar. We included nine studies with 1807 participants. The median duration of the studies was 16 weeks, ranging from 12 to 129 weeks. Treatment regimens included combinations of medications such as ambrisentan, bosentan, macitentan, tadalafil, and sildenafil. Combination therapy versus endothelin receptor antagonist Combination therapy reduces clinical worsening compared to ERA alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.68; 113 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 141 fewer to 77 fewer; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial effect (NNTB) 9, 95% CI 7 to 13; 5 trials, 1139 participants; high-certainty evidence). Hospitalisation is likely reduced (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.55; 70 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 83 fewer to 46 fewer; NNTB 14, 95% CI 12 to 22; moderate-certainty evidence). Combination therapy may result in little to no difference in mortality (low-certainty evidence), and a clinically negligible improvement in 6MWD (mean difference (MD) 19.4 m, 95% CI 10.5 to 28.3; moderate-certainty evidence). There was little to no change in Borg Dyspnea Scale (low-certainty evidence). The evidence for WHO functional class was very uncertain. There may be little to no difference in serious adverse events and trial withdrawals between the groups (low-certainty evidence). Combination therapy versus phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of combination treatment on clinical worsening compared to PDE5i alone (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.39; 142 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 298 fewer to 173 more; 4 trials, 1372 participants; very low-certainty evidence), although exclusion of high-bias studies suggested a potential benefit (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.73). The evidence on hospitalisations was very uncertainty, while there was little to no difference in mortality (low-certainty evidence). There was a clinically negligible improvement in 6MWD (MD 20.4 m, 95% CI 10.7 to 30.2; moderate-certainty evidence) and little to no change in Borg Dyspnea Scale (low-certainty evidence). The evidence for WHO functional class was very uncertain. Serious adverse events may be comparable (low-certainty evidence). Combination therapy reduces withdrawal from the trial compared to PDE5i alone (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.99; 64 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 117 fewer to 4 fewer; NNTB 16, 95% CI 9 to 250; low-certainty evidence). Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor versus endothelin receptor antagonist PDE5i likely results in little to no difference in clinical worsening compared to ERA (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.20; 3 trials, 644 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain for mortality and hospitalisation. PDE5i results in little to no difference in 6MWD compared to ERA (MD 18.4 m, 95% CI -50.2 to 86.9; low-certainty evidence). The impact on WHO functional class worsening, serious adverse events, and trial withdrawal was also uncertain, with all outcomes supported by very low- or low-certainty evidence. Overall, current data do not provide reliable conclusions on the relative efficacy or safety of PDE5i versus ERA. Combination therapy for PAH offers benefits over monotherapies, reducing clinical worsening compared to ERA alone (high certainty). Their benefits over PDE5i are less certain, although potentially favourable when studies at high risk of bias are excluded. Hospitalisation rates are likely reduced with combination therapy compared to ERA, but the effect is very uncertain when combination therapy is compared to PDE5i. Uncertainty also persists regarding its impact on mortality and functional outcomes, such as 6MWD and WHO functional class. Serious adverse events and withdrawal rates are similar between combination therapy and monotherapies, with varying levels of certainty, although withdrawals may favour combination therapy over PDE5i. Comparative analyses of PDE5i and ERA provided mixed results with varying levels of certainty. These findings could inform whether initial combination therapy should become the standard of care in people with group 1 PAH with WHO functional class levels of II or III. However, the review's limited representation of Black people raises concerns about generalisability, given the observed differences in response to ERAs between Black and White people with PAH in the literature. This review had no dedicated funding. Protocol available via DOI10.1002/14651858.CD015824.

### 23. Late (>7 days) postnatal corticosteroids for chronic lung disease in preterm infants.
**Authors:** Henry L Halliday, Richard A Ehrenkranz, Lex W Doyle

**Abstract:** Many preterm infants who survive go on to develop chronic lung disease (CLD). This is true in infants who have had respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and in infants without RDS. This is probably due to persistence of inflammation in the lung. Corticosteroids have powerful anti-inflammatory effects and have been used to treat established CLD. However, it is unclear whether any beneficial effects outweigh the adverse effects of these drugs. To determine the effect of late (> 7 days) postnatal corticosteroid treatment compared to control (placebo or nothing) in the preterm infant with CLD. Randomised controlled trials of postnatal corticosteroid therapy were sought from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE 1966 through May 2008, hand searching paediatric and perinatal journals, examining previous review articles and information received from practising neonatologists. When possible, authors of all studies were contacted to confirm details of reported follow-up studies or to obtain any information about long-term follow-up where none had been reported. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of postnatal corticosteroid treatment initiated after seven days after birth in preterm infants with or developing CLD were selected for this review. Data regarding clinical outcomes including mortality, CLD (including need for home oxygen, or need for late rescue with corticosteroids), death or CLD, failure to extubate, complications in the primary hospitalisation (including infection, hyperglycaemia, glycosuria, hypertension, echodensities on ultrasound scan of brain, necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, GI perforation, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and long-term outcomes (including blindness, deafness, cerebral palsy and major neurosensory disability), were abstracted and analysed using RevMan 5 Nineteen RCTs enrolling a total of 1345 participants were eligible for this review. Late steroid treatment was associated with a reduction in neonatal mortality (at 28 days) but not mortality at discharge or latest reported age. Beneficial effects of delayed steroid treatment included reductions in failure to extubate by 3, 7 or 28 days, CLD at both 28 days and 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (overall and in survivors), need for late rescue treatment with dexamethasone, discharge to home on oxygen therapy, and death or CLD at both 28 days and 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA). There was a trend towards an increase in risk of infection and GI bleeding but not NEC. Short-term adverse affects included hyperglycaemia, glycosuria and hypertension. There was an increase in severe ROP (overall and a trend in survivors) but no significant increase in blindness. There was trend towards a reduction in severe IVH but only 247 infants were enrolled in five studies reporting this outcome. The trends to an increase in cerebral palsy or abnormal neurological examination were partly offset by a trend in the opposite direction in death before late follow-up. The combined rate of death or cerebral palsy was not significantly different between steroid and control groups. Major neurosensory disability, and the combined rate of death or major neurosensory disability, were not significantly different between steroid and control groups. There were no substantial differences between groups for other outcomes in later childhood, including respiratory health or function, blood pressure, or growth. The benefits of late corticosteroid therapy may not outweigh actual or potential adverse effects. Although there continues to be concern about an increased incidence of adverse neurological outcomes in infants treated with postnatal steroids (see also review of "Early postnatal corticosteroids for preventing chronic lung disease in preterm infants"), this review of postnatal corticosteroid treatment for CLD initiated after seven days of age suggests that late therapy may reduce neonatal mortality without significantly increasing the risk of adverse long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, the methodological quality of the studies determining the long-term outcome is limited in some cases; in some studies the surviving children have only been assessed before school age when some important neurological outcomes cannot be determined with certainty, and no study was sufficiently powered to detect increased rates of important adverse long-term neurosensory outcomes. Given the evidence of both benefits and harms of treatment, and the limitations of the evidence at present, it appears prudent to reserve the use of late corticosteroids to infants who cannot be weaned from mechanical ventilation and to minimise the dose and duration of any course of treatment.

### 24. Trends in mortality in people with heart failure and atrial fibrillation: a population-based cohort study.
**Authors:** Nicholas R Jones, Margaret Smith, Yaling Yang, F D Richard Hobbs, Clare J Taylor

**Abstract:** Atrial fibrillation and heart failure frequently coexist but the relative effect of atrial fibrillation on survival in people with heart failure, and vice versa, remains uncertain. We aimed to report contemporary estimates of mortality among people with atrial fibrillation and heart failure and analyse trends in mortality over time. We did a retrospective cohort study of adults aged 45 years or older in England, using primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD dataset and linked secondary care data (Hospital Episode Statistics and Office for National Statistics datasets), for a total follow-up period from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2018. We recorded incident cases of heart failure and atrial fibrillation in primary or secondary care during the study period, as well as pre-existing cases at the study index date. Individuals were categorised as having both heart failure and atrial fibrillation, atrial fibrillation only, heart failure only, or neither condition, with heart failure and atrial fibrillation included in analyses as time-varying covariates. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, as recorded in primary or secondary care. We report the incidence and hazard ratios for all-cause mortality by diagnosis status, median overall survival following diagnosis, and the cumulative probability of all-cause mortality from 3 months to 10 years of follow-up and by year of diagnosis to assess trends over time. Estimates of median survival and the cumulative probability of overall mortality were restricted to incident diagnoses during the study period, and calculated overall as well as by sex, age, and Index of Multiple Deprivation quintile. The cohort consisted of 2â€‰381â€‰941 people, including 100â€‰132 initially diagnosed with heart failure only and 155â€‰061 initially diagnosed with atrial fibrillation only by the study index date or during follow-up. By the end of follow-up, 74â€‰470 people had been diagnosed with both conditions. 314â€‰042 people died during follow-up, including 42â€‰427 (57Â·0%) of those diagnosed with both heart failure and atrial fibrillation. In people diagnosed with both conditions during the study period (n=43â€‰714), median overall survival was 3Â·15 years (95% CI 3Â·08-3Â·21), and the cumulative probability of mortality was 31Â·8% (95% CI 30Â·2-33Â·6) at 1 year, 61Â·4% (59Â·4-63Â·3) at 5 years, and 80Â·2% (78Â·3-82Â·1) at 10 years after both conditions had been diagnosed, representing significantly worse rates than for an initial diagnosis of either condition alone. Similarly, the risk-adjusted hazard of all-cause mortality was highest among people with both heart failure and atrial fibrillation. For the overall population, cumulative mortality probability estimates were unchanged over successive years of diagnosis for people with both heart failure and atrial fibrillation, while showing small improvements for people initially diagnosed with heart failure only (median reduction in 10-year cumulative probability of 3Â·8% [95% CI 1Â·4-6Â·1] between diagnosis years 2000 and 2008) or atrial fibrillation only (median reduction in 1-year cumulative mortality probability of 2Â·4% [0Â·5-4Â·2] between diagnosis years 2000 and 2017) and improvement over the long-term for people diagnosed with both conditions before age 65 years (median reduction in 10-year cumulative mortality probability of 14Â·5% [95% CI 3Â·8-25Â·2] between diagnosis years 2000 and 2008). For people with both conditions, median overall survival was significantly longer in the least deprived quintile (3Â·46 years [95% CI 3Â·31-3Â·59]; n=9275) than in the most deprived quintile (2Â·67 years [2Â·51-2Â·81]; n=6302). Median overall survival in each exposure group was similar between sexes after stratifying for age. Comorbid heart failure and atrial fibrillation was common and prognosis was poor, with no improvement in mortality estimates for diagnoses over time, and the worst survival in socially deprived groups.

### 25. Interventions for weight reduction in obesity to improve survival in women with endometrial cancer.
**Authors:** Heather Agnew, Sarah Kitson, Emma J Crosbie

**Abstract:** This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 2, 2018. Diagnoses of endometrial cancer are increasing secondary to the rising prevalence of obesity. Obesity plays an important role in promoting the development of endometrial cancer, by inducing a state of unopposed oestrogen excess, insulin resistance and inflammation. It also affects treatment, increasing the risk of surgical complications and the complexity of radiotherapy planning, and may additionally impact on subsequent survival. Weight-loss interventions have been associated with improvements in breast and colorectal cancer-specific survival, as well as a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is a frequent cause of death in endometrial cancer survivors. To evaluate the benefits and harm of weight-loss interventions, in addition to standard management, on overall survival and the frequency of adverse events in women with endometrial cancer who are overweight or obese compared with any other intervention, usual care, or placebo. We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was from January 2018 to June 2022 (original review searched from inception to January 2018). We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions to facilitate weight loss in women with endometrial cancer who are overweight or obese undergoing treatment for, or previously treated for, endometrial cancer compared with any other intervention, usual care, or placebo.Â  DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. overall survival and 2. frequency of adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 3. recurrence-free survival, 4. cancer-specific survival, 5. weight loss, 6. cardiovascular and metabolic event frequency and 7. quality of Life. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. We contacted study authors to obtain missing data, including details of any adverse events. We identified nine new RCTs and combined these with the three RCTs identified in the original review. Seven studies are ongoing.Â  The 12 RCTs randomised 610 women with endometrial cancer who were overweight or obese. All studies compared combined behavioural and lifestyle interventions designed to facilitate weight loss through dietary modification and increased physical activity with usual care. Included RCTs were of low or very low quality, due to high risk of bias by failing to blind participants, personnel and outcome assessors, and significant loss to follow-up (withdrawal rate up to 28% and missing data up to 65%, largely due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic). Importantly, the short duration of follow-up limits the directness of the evidence in evaluating the impact of these interventions on any of the survival and other longer-term outcomes.Â  Combined behaviour and lifestyle interventions were not associated with improved overall survival compared with usual care at 24 months (risk ratio (RR) mortality, 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 4.55, P = 0.34; 1 RCT, 37 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence that such interventions were associated with improvements in cancer-specific survival or cardiovascular event frequency as the studies reported no cancer-related deaths, myocardial infarctions or strokes, and there was only one episode of congestive heart failure at six months (RR 3.47, 95% CI 0.15 to 82.21; P = 0.44, 5 RCTs, 211 participants; low-certainty evidence). Only one RCT reported recurrence-free survival; however, there were no events. Combined behaviour and lifestyle interventions were not associated with significant weight loss at either six or 12 months compared with usual care (at six months: mean difference (MD) -1.39 kg, 95% CI -4.04 to 1.26; P = 0.30, I

### 26. A New Measure of Quantified Social Health Is Associated With Levels of Discomfort, Capability, and Mental and General Health Among Patients Seeking Musculoskeletal Specialty Care.
**Authors:** Niels Brinkman, Melle Broekman, Teun Teunis, Seung Choi, David Ring, Prakash Jayakumar

**Abstract:** A better understanding of the correlation between social health and mindsets, comfort, and capability could aid the design of individualized care models. However, currently available social health checklists are relatively lengthy, burdensome, and designed for descriptive screening purposes rather than quantitative assessment for clinical research, patient monitoring, or quality improvement. Alternatives such as area deprivation index are prone to overgeneralization, lack depth in regard to personal circumstances, and evolve rapidly with gentrification. To fill this void, we aimed to identify the underlying themes of social health and develop a new, personalized and quantitative social health measure. (1) What underlying themes of social health (factors) among a subset of items derived from available legacy checklists and questionnaires can be identified and quantified using a brief social health measure? (2) How much of the variation in levels of discomfort, capability, general health, feelings of distress, and unhelpful thoughts regarding symptoms is accounted for by quantified social health? In this two-stage, cross-sectional study among people seeking musculoskeletal specialty care in an urban area in the United States, all English and Spanish literate adults (ages 18 to 89 years) were invited to participate in two separate cohorts to help develop a provisional new measure of quantified social health. In a first stage (December 2021 to August 2022) , 291 patients rated a subset of items derived from commonly used social health checklists and questionnaires (Tool for Health and Resilience in Vulnerable Environments [THRIVE]; Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patient Assets, Risks and Experiences [PRAPARE]; and Accountable Health Communities Health-Related Social Needs Screening Tool [HRSN]), of whom 95% (275 of 291; 57% women; mean Â± SD age 49 Â± 16 years; 51% White, 33% Hispanic; 21% Spanish speaking; 38% completed high school or less) completed all items required to perform factor analysis and were included. Given that so few patients decline participation (estimated at < 5%), we did not track them. We then randomly parsed participants into (1) a learning cohort (69% [189 of 275]) used to identify underlying themes of social health and develop a new measure of quantified social health using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and (2) a validation cohort (31% [86 of 275]) used to test and internally validate the findings on data not used in its development. During the validation process, we found inconsistencies in the correlations of quantified social health with levels of discomfort and capability between the learning and validation cohort that could not be resolved or explained despite various sensitivity analyses. We therefore identified an additional cohort of 356 eligible patients (February 2023 to June 2023) to complete a new extended subset of items directed at financial security and social support (5 items from the initial stage and 11 new items derived from the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, Financial Well-Being Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey, and 6-item Social Support Questionnaire, and "I have to work multiple jobs in order to finance my life" was self-created), of whom 95% (338 of 356; 53% women; mean Â± SD age 48 Â± 16 years; 38% White, 48% Hispanic; 31% Spanish speaking; 47% completed high school or less) completed all items required to perform factor analysis and were included. We repeated factor analysis to identify the underlying themes of social health and then applied item response theory-based graded response modeling to identify the items that were best able to measure differences in social health (high item discrimination) with the lowest possible floor and ceiling effects (proportion of participants with lowest or highest possible score, respectively; a range of different item difficulties). We also assessed the CFA factor loadings (correlation of an individual item with the identified factor) and modification indices (parameters that suggest whether specific changes to the model would improve model fit appreciably). We then iteratively removed items based on low factor loadings (< 0.4, generally regarded as threshold for items to be considered stable) and high modification indices until model fit in CFA was acceptable (root mean square of error approximation [RMSEA] < 0.05). We then assessed local dependencies among the remaining items (strong relationships between items unrelated to the underlying factor) using Yen Q3 and aimed to combine only items with local dependencies of < 0.25. Because we exhausted our set of items, we were not able to address all local dependencies. Among the remaining items, we then repeated CFA to assess model fit (RMSEA) and used Cronbach alpha to assess internal consistency (the extent to which different subsets of the included items would provide the same measurement outcomes). We performed a differential item functioning analysis to assess whether certain items are rated discordantly based on differences in self-reported age, gender, race, or level of education, which can introduce bias. Last, we assessed the correlations of the new quantified social health measure with various self-reported sociodemographic characteristics (external validity) as well as level of discomfort, capability, general health, and mental health (clinical relevance) using bivariate and multivariable linear regression analyses. We identified two factors representing financial security (11 items) and social support (5 items). After removing problematic items based on our prespecified protocol, we selected 5 items to address financial security (including "I am concerned that the money I have or will save won't last") and 4 items to address social support (including "There is a special person who is around when I am in need"). The selected items of the new quantified social health measure (Social Health Scale [SHS]) displayed good model fit in CFA (RMSEA 0.046, confirming adequate factor structure) and good internal consistency (Cronbach Î± = 0.80 to 0.84), although there were some remaining local dependencies that could not be resolved by removing items because we exhausted our set of items. We found that more disadvantaged quantitative social health was moderately associated with various sociodemographic characteristics (self-reported Black race [regression coefficient (RC) 2.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29 to 4.9)], divorced [RC 2.5 (95% CI 0.23 to 4.8)], unemployed [RC 1.7 (95% CI 0.023 to 3.4)], uninsured [RC 3.5 (95% CI 0.33 to 6.7)], and earning less than USD 75,000 per year [RC 2.7 (95% CI 0.020 to 5.4) to 6.8 (95% CI 4.3 to 9.3)]), slightly with higher levels of discomfort (RC 0.055 [95% CI 0.16 to 0.093]), slightly with lower levels of capability (RC -0.19 [95% CI -0.34 to -0.035]), slightly with worse general health (RC 0.13 [95% CI 0.069 to 0.18]), moderately with higher levels of unhelpful thoughts (RC 0.17 [95% CI 0.13 to 0.22]), and moderately with greater feelings of distress (RC 0.23 [95% CI 0.19 to 0.28]). A quantitative measure of social health with domains of financial security and social support had acceptable psychometric properties and seems clinically relevant given the associations with levels of discomfort, capability, and general health. It is important to mention that people with disadvantaged social health should not be further disadvantaged by using a quantitative measure of social health to screen or cherry pick in contexts of incentivized or mandated reporting, which could worsen inequities in access and care. Rather, one should consider disadvantaged social health and its associated stressors as one of several previously less considered and potentially modifiable aspects of comprehensive musculoskeletal health. A personalized, quantitative measure of social health would be useful to better capture and understand the role of social health in comprehensive musculoskeletal specialty care. The SHS can be used to measure the distinct contribution of social health to various aspects of musculoskeletal health to inform development of personalized, whole-person care pathways. Clinicians may also use the SHS to identify and monitor patients with disadvantaged social circumstances. This line of inquiry may benefit from additional research including a larger number of items focused on a broader range of social health to further develop the SHS.

### 28. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for critically ill adults.
**Authors:** Ralph Tramm, Dragan Ilic, Andrew R Davies, Vincent A Pellegrino, Lorena Romero, Carol Hodgson

**Abstract:** Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a form of life support that targets the heart and lungs. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe respiratory failure accesses and returns blood from the venous system and provides non-pulmonary gas exchange. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe cardiac failure or for refractory cardiac arrest (extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR)) provides gas exchange and systemic circulation. The configuration of ECMO is variable, and several pump-driven and pump-free systems are in use. Use of ECMO is associated with several risks. Patient-related adverse events include haemorrhage or extremity ischaemia; circuit-related adverse effects may include pump failure, oxygenator failure and thrombus formation. Use of ECMO in newborns and infants is well established, yet its clinical effectiveness in adults remains uncertain. The primary objective of this systematic review was to determine whether use of veno-venous (VV) or venous-arterial (VA) ECMO in adults is more effective in improving survival compared with conventional respiratory and cardiac support. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE (Ovid) on 18 August 2014. We searched conference proceedings, meeting abstracts, reference lists of retrieved articles and databases of ongoing trials and contacted experts in the field. We imposed no restrictions on language or location of publications. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and cluster-RCTs that compared adult ECMO versus conventional support. Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of all retrieved citations against the inclusion criteria. We independently reviewed full-text copies of studies that met the inclusion criteria. We entered all data extracted from the included studies into Review Manager. Two review authors independently performed risk of bias assessment. All included studies were appraised with respect to random sequence generation, concealment of allocation, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other bias. We included four RCTs that randomly assigned 389 participants with acute respiratory failure. Risk of bias was low in three RCTs and high in one RCT. We found no statistically significant differences in all-cause mortality at six months (two RCTs) or before six months (during 30 days of randomization in one trial and during hospital stay in another RCT). The quality of the evidence was low to moderate, and further research is very likely to impact our confidence in the estimate of effects because significant changes have been noted in ECMO applications and treatment modalities over study periods to the present.Two RCTs supplied data on disability. In one RCT survival was low in both groups but none of the survivors had limitations in their daily activities six months after discharge. The other RCT reported improved survival without severe disability in the intervention group (transfer to an ECMO centre Â± ECMO) six months after study randomization but no statistically significant differences in health-related quality of life.In three RCTs, participants in the ECMO group received greater numbers of blood transfusions. One RCT recorded significantly more non-brain haemorrhage in the ECMO group. Another RCT reported two serious adverse events in the ECMO group, and another reported three adverse events in the ECMO group.Clinical heterogeneity between studies prevented meta-analyses across outcomes. We found no completed RCT that had investigated ECMO in the context of cardiac failure or arrest. We found one ongoing RCT that examined patients with acute respiratory failure and two ongoing RCTs that included patients with acute cardiac failure (arrest). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation remains a rescue therapy. Since the year 2000, patient treatment and practice with ECMO have considerably changed as the result of research findings and technological advancements over time. Over the past four decades, only four RCTs have been published that compared the intervention versus conventional treatment at the time of the study. Clinical heterogeneity across these published studies prevented pooling of data for a meta-analysis.We recommend combining results of ongoing RCTs with results of trials conducted after the year 2000 if no significant shifts in technology or treatment occur. Until these new results become available, data on use of ECMO in patients with acute respiratory failure remain inconclusive. For patients with acute cardiac failure or arrest, outcomes of ongoing RCTs will assist clinicians in determining what role ECMO and ECPR can play in patient care.

### 29. Systemic pharmacological treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis: a network meta-analysis.
**Authors:** Emilie Sbidian, Anna Chaimani, Ignacio Garcia-Doval, Liz Doney, Corinna Dressler, Camille Hua, Carolyn Hughes, Luigi Naldi, Sivem Afach, Laurence Le Cleach

**Abstract:** Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease for which some people have a genetic predisposition. The condition manifests in inflammatory effects on either the skin or joints, or both, and it has a major impact on quality of life. Although there is currently no cure for psoriasis, various treatment strategies allow sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of the different systemic treatments in psoriasis against placebo. However, the relative benefit of these treatments remains unclear due to the limited number of trials comparing them directly head-to-head, which is why we chose to conduct a network meta-analysis. To compare the efficacy and safety of non-biological systemic agents, small molecules, and biologics for people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis using a network meta-analysis, and to provide a ranking of these treatments according to their efficacy and safety. For this living systematic review we updated our searches of the following databases monthly to September 2020: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase. We searched two trials registers to the same date. We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for further references to eligible RCTs. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic treatments in adults (over 18 years of age) with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis whose skin had been clinically diagnosed with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, in comparison to placebo or another active agent. The primary outcomes of this review were: the proportion of participants who achieved clear or almost clear skin, that is, at least Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 at induction phase (from 8 to 24 weeks after the randomisation), and the proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) at induction phase. We did not evaluate differences in specific adverse events. Several groups of two review authors independently undertook study selection, data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and analyses. We synthesised the data using pair-wise and network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the treatments of interest and rank them according to their effectiveness (as measured by the PASI 90 score) and acceptability (the inverse of serious adverse events). We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence from the NMA for the two primary outcomes and all comparisons, according to CINeMA, as either very low, low, moderate, or high. We contacted study authors when data were unclear or missing. We used the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) to infer on treatment hierarchy: 0% (treatment is the worst for effectiveness or safety) to 100% (treatment is the best for effectiveness or safety). We included 158 studies (18 new studies for the update) in our review (57,831 randomised participants, 67.2% men, mainly recruited from hospitals). The overall average age was 45 years; the overall mean PASI score at baseline was 20 (range: 9.5 to 39). Most of these studies were placebo-controlled (58%), 30% were head-to-head studies, and 11% were multi-armed studies with both an active comparator and a placebo. We have assessed a total of 20 treatments. In all, 133Â trials were multicentric (two to 231 centres). All but two of the outcomes included in this review were limited to the induction phase (assessment from 8 to 24 weeks after randomisation). We assessed many studies (53/158) as being at high risk of bias; 25 were at an unclear risk, and 80 at low risk. Most studies (123/158) declared funding by a pharmaceutical company, and 22 studies did not report their source of funding. Network meta-analysis at class level showed that all of the interventions (non-biological systemic agents, small molecules, and biological treatments) were significantly more effective than placebo in reaching PASI 90. At class level, in reaching PASI 90, the biologic treatments anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha were significantly more effective than the small molecules and the non-biological systemic agents. At drug level, infliximab, ixekizumab, secukinumab, brodalumab, risankizumab and guselkumab were significantly more effective in reaching PASI 90 than ustekinumab and three anti-TNF alpha agents: adalimumab, certolizumab, and etanercept. Ustekinumab and adalimumab were significantly more effective in reaching PASI 90 than etanercept; ustekinumab was more effective than certolizumab, and the clinical effectiveness of ustekinumab and adalimumab was similar. There was no significant difference between tofacitinib or apremilast and three non-biological drugs: fumaric acid esters (FAEs), ciclosporin and methotrexate. Network meta-analysis also showed that infliximab, ixekizumab, risankizumab, bimekizumab, secukinumab, guselkumab, and brodalumab outperformed other drugs when compared to placebo in reaching PASI 90. The clinical effectiveness of these drugs was similar, except for ixekizumab which had a better chance of reaching PASI 90 compared with secukinumab, guselkumab and brodalumab. The clinical effectiveness of these seven drugs was: infliximab (versus placebo): risk ratio (RR) 50.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 20.96 to 120.67, SUCRAÂ = 93.6; high-certainty evidence; ixekizumab (versus placebo): RR 32.48, 95% CI 27.13 to 38.87; SUCRA = 90.5; high-certainty evidence; risankizumab (versus placebo): RR 28.76, 95% CI 23.96 to 34.54; SUCRA = 84.6; high-certainty evidence; bimekizumab (versus placebo): RR 58.64, 95% CI 3.72 to 923.86; SUCRA = 81.4; high-certainty evidence; secukinumab (versus placebo): RR 25.79, 95% CI 21.61 to 30.78; SUCRA = 76.2; high-certainty evidence; guselkumab (versus placebo): RR 25.52, 95% CI 21.25 to 30.64; SUCRA = 75; high-certainty evidence; and brodalumab (versus placebo): RR 23.55, 95% CI 19.48 to 28.48; SUCRA = 68.4; moderate-certainty evidence. Conservative interpretation is warranted for the results for bimekizumab (as well as mirikizumab, tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor, acitretin, ciclosporin, fumaric acid esters, and methotrexate), as these drugs, in the NMA, have been evaluated in few trials. We found no significant difference between any of the interventions and the placebo for the risk of SAEs. Nevertheless, the SAE analyses were based on a very low number of events with low to moderate certainty for all the comparisons. Thus, the results have to be viewed with caution and we cannot be sure of the ranking. For other efficacy outcomes (PASI 75 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) 0/1) the results were similar to the results for PASI 90. Information on quality of life was often poorly reported and was absent for several of the interventions. Our review shows that compared to placebo, the biologics infliximab, ixekizumab, risankizumab, bimekizumab, secukinumab, guselkumab and brodalumab were the most effective treatments for achieving PASI 90 in people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis on the basis of moderate- to high-certainty evidence. This NMA evidence is limited to induction therapy (outcomes were measured from 8 to 24 weeks after randomisation) and is not sufficient for evaluation of longer-term outcomes in this chronic disease. Moreover, we found low numbers of studies for some of the interventions, and the young age (mean age of 45 years) and high level of disease severity (PASI 20 at baseline) may not be typical of patients seen in daily clinical practice. Another major concern is that short-term trials provide scanty and sometimes poorly-reported safety data and thus do not provide useful evidence to create a reliable risk profile of treatments. We found no significant difference in the assessed interventions and placebo in terms of SAEs, and the evidence for all the interventions was of low to moderate quality. In order to provide long-term information on the safety of the treatments included in this review, it will also be necessary to evaluate non-randomised studies and postmarketing reports released from regulatory agencies. In terms of future research, randomised trials directly comparing active agents are necessary once high-quality evidence of benefit against placebo is established, including head-to-head trials amongst and between non-biological systemic agents and small molecules, and between biological agents (anti-IL17 versus anti-IL23, anti-IL23 versus anti-IL12/23, anti-TNF alpha versus anti-IL12/23). Future trials should also undertake systematic subgroup analyses (e.g. assessing biological-naÃ¯ve participants, baseline psoriasis severity, presence of psoriatic arthritis, etc.). Finally, outcome measure harmonisation is needed in psoriasis trials, and researchers should look at the medium- and long-term benefit and safety of the interventions and the comparative safety of different agents. Editorial note: This is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating, in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review.

### 30. Normothermic and hypothermic machine perfusion preservation versus static cold storage for deceased donor kidney transplantation.
**Authors:** Samuel J Tingle, Emily R Thompson, Rodrigo S Figueiredo, John Ag Moir, Michael Goodfellow, David Talbot, Colin H Wilson

**Abstract:** Kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for kidney failure. Donation, transport and transplant of kidney grafts leads to significant ischaemia reperfusion injury. Static cold storage (SCS), whereby the kidney is stored on ice after removal from the donor until the time of implantation, represents the simplest preservation method. However, technology is now available to perfuse or "pump" the kidney during the transport phase ("continuous") or at the recipient centre ("end-ischaemic"). This can be done at a variety of temperatures and using different perfusates. The effectiveness of these treatments manifests as improved kidney function post-transplant. To compare machine perfusion (MP) technologies (hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) and (sub) normothermic machine perfusion (NMP)) with each other and with standard SCS. We contacted the information specialist and searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies until 15 June 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing machine perfusion techniques with each other or versus SCS for deceased donor kidney transplantation were eligible for inclusion. All donor types were included (donor after circulatory death (DCD) and brainstem death (DBD), standard and extended/expanded criteria donors). Both paired and unpaired studies were eligible for inclusion. The results of the literature search were screened, and a standard data extraction form was used to collect data. Both of these steps were performed by two independent authors. Dichotomous outcome results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Survival analyses (time-to-event) were performed with the generic inverse variance meta-analysis of hazard ratios (HR). Continuous scales of measurement were expressed as a mean difference (MD). Random effects models were used for data analysis. The primary outcome was the incidence of delayed graft function (DGF). Secondary outcomes included graft survival, incidence of primary non-function (PNF), DGF duration, economic implications, graft function, patient survival and incidence of acute rejection. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Twenty-two studies (4007 participants) were included. The risk of bias was generally low across all studies and bias domains. The majority of the evidence compared non-oxygenated HMP with standard SCS (19 studies). The use of non-oxygenated HMP reduces the rate of DGF compared to SCS (16 studies, 3078 participants: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.88; P < 0.0001; I Continuous non-oxygenated HMP is superior to SCS in deceased donor kidney transplantation, reducing DGF, improving graft survival and proving cost-effective. This is true for both DBD and DCD kidneys, both short and long CITs, and remains true in the modern era (studies performed after 2008). In DCD donors (> 50 years), the simple addition of oxygen to continuous HMP further improves graft survival, kidney function and acute rejection rate compared to non-oxygenated HMP. Timing of HMP is important, and benefits have not been demonstrated with short periods (median 4.6 hours) of end-ischaemic HMP. End-ischaemic NMP (one hour) does not confer meaningful benefits over SCS alone and is inferior to continuous HMP in an indirect comparison of graft survival. Further studies assessing NMP for viability assessment and therapeutic delivery are warranted and in progress.

### 31. Hepatitis B Virus NAT Positive Donors in Non-Hepatic Organ Transplant: Quantifying Viral Loads to Optimize Recipient Risk Stratification and Management in the Prevention of Donor-Derived Infection.
**Authors:** Patrick C K Tam, Goni Katz-Greenberg, Cameron R Wolfe, Kristen Lott, Carl L Berg, Adam D DeVore, John M Reynolds, Jennifer L Saullo

**Abstract:** Transplantation is one of the few life-saving therapies for patients with end-stage organ disease, yet organ availability remains restrictive. Expanding donors to include those with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, incorporating HBV nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) positive donors, could improve organ access. However, the risk of donor-derived HBV transmission and recipient management of organs transplanted from HBV NAT-positive donors, particularly in thoracic organ recipients, is limited. We conducted a single-center retrospective study to assess the safety and outcomes in recipients of non-hepatic organ transplants from HBV NAT-positive donors. Over a 4.5-year period, 25 transplant recipients, including 16 thoracic organ recipients, received organs from 22 unique, qualitative HBV NAT-positive donors. All recipients were HBV surface antibody-positive prior to transplant. Quantitative NAT was performed in 20/22 (91%) donors with values ranging from 0 to 1 280 000 IU/mL; 8/22 (36%) donors had HBV NAT values that were undetected or below the lower limit of quantification. All recipients were administered HBV immunoglobulin (HBIG) and received HBV active antiviral therapy post-transplant. Recipients were followed post-transplant for a median of 250 days (IQR: 169-467 days). No recipients developed de novo HBV infection characterized by HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seroconversion, quantifiable HBV NAT detection, or sustained HBV core antibody (HbcAb) seroconversion post-transplant. Similarly, no recipient developed liver dysfunction or died due to HBV infection. Quantifying HBV from NAT-positive donors may better inform the risk of donor-derived infection in recipients, and the use of these organs incorporating a multimodal prevention strategy could safely increase the donor pool.

### 32. Forced vital capacity reduction severity in pulmonary fibrosis and post-lung transplantation outcomes.
**Authors:** Manon LevÃªque, Julien Bermudez, Ana Nieves, Florence Daviet, Antoine Roux, Xavier Demant, Benjamin Renaud-Picard, JÃ©rÃ´me Le Pavec, HervÃ© Mal, Thomas Villeneuve, Jean-FranÃ§ois Mornex, LoÃ¯c Falque, VÃ©ronique Boussaud, Christiane Knoop, Adrien Tissot, Martine Reynaud-Gaubert, Benjamin Coiffard

**Abstract:** The ISHLT guidelines recommend early referral to a lung transplantation (LTx) center for patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) due to the unpredictable course. To our knowledge, no study has assessed the impact of forced vital capacity (FVC) reduction severity on LTx outcomes in ILD. This study aims to determine whether the severity of FVC reduction is associated with post-transplant outcomes in ILD. Recipients from the French multicentric COLT cohort who underwent lung transplantation for ILD were included in this study. FVC was assessed to determine if the severity of its reduction is associated with post-transplant outcomes. 311 recipients were included in the study. FVC was identified as a significant risk factor for mortality at one year in multivariate analysis (p = 0.003). The ROC curve for FVC estimated the probability of death at one year with an area under the curve of 64 % (95 % confidence interval 57-71 %) and defined an optimal FVC threshold of 46 %. Recipients with an FVC â‰¤46 % were more likely to be listed as emergency cases, had lower FVC at one year, and exhibited reduced short- and long-term survival. The severity of pre-transplant FVC reduction is a risk factor for poorer post-transplant outcomes. The findings should stimulate discussion about benefits of LTx for patients with lower FVC. An FVC threshold of â‰¤46 % should be considered in discussions about lung transplantation indications, decisions regarding single lung transplantation, and the selection of smaller donor lungs. Respirologists managing patients with ILD should consider early referral to a LTx center.

### 33. Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty versus penetrating keratoplasty for treating keratoconus.
**Authors:** Miriam Keane, Douglas Coster, Mohammed Ziaei, Keryn Williams

**Abstract:** Keratoconus is an ectatic (weakening) disease of the cornea, which is the clear surface at the front of the eye. Approximately 10% to 15% of patients diagnosed with keratoconus require corneal transplantation. This may be full-thickness (penetrating) or partial-thickness (lamellar). To compare visual outcomes after deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) and penetrating keratoplasty for keratoconus, and to compare additional outcomes relating to factors which may contribute to poor visual outcomes (e.g. astigmatism, graft rejection and failure). We searched a number of electronic databases including CENTRAL, PubMed and EMBASE without using any date or language restrictions. We last searched the electronic databases on 31 October 2013. We also handsearched the proceedings of several international ophthalmic conferences. We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the outcomes of DALK and penetrating keratoplasty in the treatment of keratoconus. Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data independently. For dichotomous data (graft failure, rejection, achievement of functional vision) results were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data (postoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), keratometric astigmatism and spherical equivalent) results were expressed as mean differences (MDs) and 95% CIs. We identified two completed studies, with a total of 111 participants (n = 30 and n = 81), both conducted in Iran, that met our inclusion criteria. Participants had moderate to severe keratoconus pre-operatively and were randomly allocated to receive either DALK or penetrating keratoplasty. Only one eye of each participant was treated as part of the trials. The smaller study had 12 month follow-up data for all participants. For the larger study, four DALK surgeries had to be abandoned due to technical failure and visual and refractive outcomes were not measured in these participants. Follow-up length for the remaining 77 participants ranged from 6.8 to 36.4 months, with all 77 followed for at least three months post-suture removal. Details of the randomisation procedure were unavailable for the smaller study and so sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine if the results from this study had affected the overall results of the review.Neither of the included studies reported a difference between groups on any of the measures of post-graft visual achievement, keratometric astigmatism or spherical equivalent. A single case of graft failure in a penetrating keratoplasty was reported. No postoperative graft failures were reported in the DALK group of either study.Instances of graft rejection were reported in both groups, in both studies. The majority of these cases were successfully treated with steroids. The data, which related to all cases in each study - given that the four cases that did not go ahead as planned had already technically failed without presence of rejection - showed that rejection was less likely to occur in DALK (odds ratio (OR): 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.81, GRADE rating: moderate).Results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that inclusion of the Razmju 2011 study did not bias the results with regards to rejection episodes. While sensitivity analysis showed altered results with regards to failure rates, the data available from the Javadi 2010 study alone had a very wide 95% CI, suggesting an imprecise estimate. Therefore, even after removal of the Razmju 2011 data, it is still difficult to draw conclusions regarding superiority of one technique over another with regards to graft failure.DALK was unable to be completed as planned in four cases and in a further three cases, complications during dissection required further intervention. Other adverse events, of varying severity, were reported in both intervention groups with similar frequency. For both types of surgery, these included postoperative astigmatism, steroid induced ocular hypertension and persistent epithelial defects. In recipients of DALK, one participant had interface neovascularisation (a proliferation of blood vessels where the host and donor cornea come together) and one had wrinkling of Descemet's membrane, the basement membrane separating the corneal stroma from the corneal endothelium. In the penetrating keratoplasty groups, one participant required graft resuturing and one had an atonic pupil, a condition in which the pupil dilates and is non-reactive.Overall, the quality of the evidence was rated as very low to moderate, with methodological limitations, incomplete data analysis and imprecision of findings, as well as high risk of bias in several areas for both studies. We found no evidence to support a difference in outcomes with regards to BCVA at three months post-graft or at any of the other time points analysed (GRADE rating: very low). We also found no evidence of a difference in outcomes with regards to graft survival, final UCVA or keratometric outcomes. We found some evidence that rejection is more likely to occur following penetrating keratoplasty than DALK (GRADE rating: moderate). The small number of studies included in the review and methodological issues relating to the two, mean that the overall quality of the evidence in this review is low. There is currently insufficient evidence to determine which technique may offer better overall outcomes - final visual acuity and time to attain this, keratometric stabilisation, risk of rejection or failure, or both, and risk of other adverse events - for patients with keratoconus. Large randomised trials comparing the outcomes of penetrating keratoplasty and DALK in the treatment of keratoconus are needed.

### 34. Preoperative blood transfusions for sickle cell disease.
**Authors:** Lise J Estcourt, Patricia M Fortin, Marialena Trivella, Sally Hopewell

**Abstract:** Sickle cell disease is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. Sickle cell disease can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Surgical interventions are more common in people with sickle cell disease, and occur at much younger ages than in the general population. Blood transfusions are frequently used prior to surgery and several regimens are used but there is no consensus over the best method or the necessity of transfusion in specific surgical cases. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001. To determine whether there is evidence that preoperative blood transfusion in people with sickle cell disease undergoing elective or emergency surgery reduces mortality and perioperative or sickle cell-related serious adverse events.To compare the effectiveness of different transfusion regimens (aggressive or conservative) if preoperative transfusions are indicated in people with sickle cell disease. We searched for relevant trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 23 March 2016.We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register: 18 January 2016. All randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing preoperative blood transfusion regimens to different regimens or no transfusion in people with sickle cell disease undergoing elective or emergency surgery. There was no restriction by outcomes examined, language or publication status. Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and the risk of bias and extracted data. Three trials with 990 participants were eligible for inclusion in the review. There were no ongoing trials identified. These trials were conducted between 1988 and 2011. The majority of people included had haemoglobin (Hb) SS SCD. The majority of surgical procedures were considered low or intermediate risk for developing sickle cell-related complications. Aggressive versus simple red blood cell transfusions One trial (551 participants) compared an aggressive transfusion regimen (decreasing sickle haemoglobin to less than 30%) to a simple transfusion regimen (increasing haemoglobin to 100 g/l). This trial re-randomised participants and therefore quantitative analysis was only possible on two subsets of data: participants undergoing cholecystectomy (230 participants); and participants undergoing tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy surgeries (107 participants). Data were not combined as we do not know if any participant received both surgeries. Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trial being at high risk of bias primarily due to lack of blinding, indirectness and the outcome estimates being imprecise. Cholecystectomy subgroup results are reported in the abstract. Results for both subgroups were similar.There was no difference in all-cause mortality between people receiving aggressive transfusions and those receiving conservative transfusions. No deaths occurred in either subgroup.There were no differences between the aggressive transfusion group and conservative transfusion group in the number of people developing:â€¢ an acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.38 to 1.84) (one trial, 230 participants, very low quality evidence);â€¢ vaso-occlusive crisis, risk ratio 0.30 (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 1.04) (one trial, 230 participants, very low quality evidence);â€¢ serious infection, risk ratio 1.75 (95% confidence interval 0.59 to 5.18) (one trial, 230 participants, very low quality evidence);â€¢ any perioperative complications, risk ratio 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 1.55) (one trial, 230 participants, very low quality evidence);â€¢ a transfusion-related complication, risk ratio 1.85 (95% confidence interval 0.89 to 3.88) (one trial, 230 participants, very low quality evidence). Preoperative transfusion versus no preoperative transfusion Two trials (434 participants) compared a preoperative transfusion plus standard care to a group receiving standard care. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trials being at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, and outcome estimates being imprecise. One trial was stopped early because more people in the no transfusion arm developed an acute chest syndrome.There was no difference in all-cause mortality between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those receiving no preoperative transfusions (two trials, 434 participants, no deaths occurred).There was significant heterogeneity between the two trials in the number of people developing an acute chest syndrome, a meta-analysis was therefore not performed. One trial showed a reduced number of people developing acute chest syndrome between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those receiving no preoperative transfusions, risk ratio 0.11 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.80) (65 participants), whereas the other trial did not, risk ratio 4.81 (95% confidence interval 0.23 to 99.61) (369 participants).There were no differences between the preoperative transfusion groups and the groups without preoperative transfusion in the number of people developing:â€¢ a vaso-occlusive crisis, Peto odds ratio 1.91 (95% confidence interval 0.61 to 6.04) (two trials, 434 participants, very low quality evidence).â€¢ a serious infection, Peto odds ratio 1.29 (95% confidence interval 0.29 to 5.71) (two trials, 434 participants, very low quality evidence);â€¢ any perioperative complications, risk ratio 0.24 (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 2.05) (one trial, 65 participants, low quality evidence).There was an increase in the number of people developing circulatory overload in those receiving preoperative transfusions compared to those not receiving preoperative transfusions in one of the two trials, and no events were seen in the other trial (no meta-analysis performed). There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to determine whether conservative preoperative blood transfusion is as effective as aggressive preoperative blood transfusion in preventing sickle-related or surgery-related complications in people with HbSS disease. There is very low quality evidence that preoperative blood transfusion may prevent development of acute chest syndrome.Due to lack of evidence this review cannot comment on management for people with HbSC or HbSÎ²(+) disease or for those with high baseline haemoglobin concentrations.

### 35. Sex and gender as predictors for allograft and patient-relevant outcomes after kidney transplantation.
**Authors:** Sumedh Jayanti, Nadim A Beruni, Juanita N Chui, Danny Deng, Amy Liang, Anita S Chong, Jonathan C Craig, Bethany Foster, Martin Howell, Siah Kim, Roslyn B Mannon, Ruth Sapir-Pichhadze, Nicole J Scholes-Robertson, Alexandra T Strauss, Allison Jaure, Lori West, Tess E Cooper, Germaine Wong

**Abstract:** Sex, as a biological construct, and gender, defined as the cultural attitudes and behaviours attributed by society, may be associated with allograft loss, death, cancer, and rejection. Other factors, such as recipient age and donor sex, may modify the association between sex/gender and post-transplant outcomes. We sought to evaluate the prognostic effects of recipient sex and, separately, gender as independent predictors of graft loss, death, cancer, and allograft rejection following kidney or simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation. We aimed to evaluate this prognostic effect by defining the relationship between recipient sex or gender and post-transplantation outcomes identifying reasons for variations between sexes and genders, and then quantifying the magnitude of this relationship. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception up to 12 April 2023, through contact with the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Information Specialist, using search terms relevant to this review and no language restrictions. Cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies were included if sex or gender were the primary exposure and clearly defined. Studies needed to focus on our defined outcomes post-transplantation. Sex was defined as the chromosomal, gonadal, and anatomical characteristics associated with the biological sex, and we used the terms "males" and "females". Gender was defined as the attitudes and behaviours that a given culture associates with a person's biological sex, and we used the terms "men" and "women". Two authors independently assessed the references for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Whenever appropriate, we performed random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the mean difference in outcomes. The outcomes of interest included the Standardised Outcomes in Nephrology-Kidney Transplant (SONG-Tx) core outcomes, allograft loss, death, cancer (overall incidence and site-specific) and acute or chronic graft rejection. Fifty-three studies (2,144,613 patients; range 59 to 407,963) conducted between 1990 and 2023 were included. Sixteen studies were conducted in the Americas, 12 in Europe, 11 in the Western Pacific, four in the Eastern Mediterranean, three in Africa, two in Southeast Asia, and five across multiple regions. All but one study focused on sex rather than gender as the primary exposure of interest. The number identified as male was 54%; 49 studies included kidney transplant recipients, and four studies included SPK transplant recipients. Twenty-four studies included adults and children, 25 studies included only adults, and four studies included only children. Data from 33 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Among these, six studies presented unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs) that assessed the effect of recipient sex on kidney allograft loss. The other studies reported risk ratios (RRs) for the pre-defined outcomes. Notably, the decision to restrict the meta-analyses to unadjusted estimates arose from the variation in covariate adjustment methods across studies, lacking a common set of adjusted variables. Only three studies considered the modifying effect of recipient age on graft loss or death, which is likely crucial to evaluating sex differences in post-transplant outcomes. No studies considered the modifying effect of recipient age on cancer incidence or allograft rejection risk. In low certainty evidence, compared with male recipients, being female may make little or no difference in kidney allograft loss post-transplantation (7 studies, 5843 patients: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.12; I There is very low to low certainty evidence to suggest there are no differences in kidney and pancreas allograft survival, patient survival, cancer, and acute and chronic allograft rejection between male and female kidney and SPK transplant recipients.

### 36. Chemotherapy alone versus chemotherapy plus radiotherapy for adults with early stage Hodgkin lymphoma.
**Authors:** Oliver Blank, Bastian von Tresckow, Ina Monsef, Lena Specht, Andreas Engert, Nicole Skoetz

**Abstract:** Combined modality treatment consisting of chemotherapy followed by localised radiotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with early stage Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). However, due to long- term adverse effects such as secondary malignancies the role of radiotherapy has been questioned recently and some clinical study groups advocate chemotherapy only for this indication. To assess the effects of chemotherapy alone compared to chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in adults with early stage HL . For the or i ginal version of this review, we searched MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL as well as conference proceedings (American Society of Hematology, American Society of Clinical Oncology and International Symposium of Hodgkin Lymphoma) from January 1980 to November 2010 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chemotherapy alone versus chemotherapy regimens plus radiotherapy.Â For the updated review we searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL and conference proceedings to December 2016. We included RCTs comparing chemotherapy alone with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in patients with early stage HL. We excluded trials with more than 20% of patients in advanced stage. As the value of radiotherapy in addition to chemotherapy is still not clear, we also compared to more cycles of chemotherapy in the control arm. In this updated review, we also included a second comparison evaluating trials with varying numbers of cycles of chemotherapy between intervention and control arms, same chemotherapy regimen in both arms assumed. We excluded trials evaluating children only, therefore only trials involving adults are included in this updated review. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of trials. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information. As effect measures we used hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) and risk ratios (RR) for response rates. Since not all trials reported PFS according to our definitions, we evaluated all similar outcomes (e.g. event-free survival) as PFS/tumour control. Our search led to 5518 potentially relevant references. From these, we included seven RCTs in the analyses involving 2564 patients. In contrast to the first version of this review including five trials, we excluded trials randomising children. As a result, we excluded one trial from the former analyses and we identified three new trials.Five trials with 1388 patients compared the combination of chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy plus radiotherapy, with the same number of chemotherapy cycles in both arms. The addition of radiotherapy to chemotherapy has probably little or no difference on OS (HR 0.48; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.06; P = 0.07, moderate- quality evidence), however two included trials had potential other high risk of bias due to a high number of patients not receiving planned radiotherapy. After excluding these trials in a sensitivity analysis, the results showed that the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy improved OS compared to chemotherapy alone (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.52; P <0.00001, moderate- quality evidence). In contrast to chemotherapy alone the use of chemotherapy and radiotherapy improved PFS (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.72; P = 0.001; moderate- quality evidence). Regarding infection- related mortality (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.01 to 8.06; P = 0.5; low- quality evidence), second cancer- related mortality (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.07 to 4.29; P = 0.55; low- quality evidence) and cardiac disease- related mortality (RR 2.94; 95% CI 0.31 to 27.55; P = 0.35;low- quality evidence), there is no evidence for a difference between the use of chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy plus radiotherapy. For complete response rate (CRR) (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.25; P = 0.33; low- quality evidence), there is also no evidence for a difference between treatment groups.Two trials with 1176 patients compared the combination of chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy plus radiotherapy, with different numbers of chemotherapy cycles in both arms. OS is reported in one trial only, the use of chemotherapy alone (more chemotherapy cycles) may improve OS compared to chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (HR 2.12; 95% CI 1.03 to 4.37; P = 0.04; low- quality evidence). This trial also had a potential other high risk of bias due to a high number of patients not receiving planned therapy. There is no evidence for a difference between chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy plus radiotherapy regarding PFS (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.14 to 1.24; P = 0.12; low- quality evidence). After excluding the trial with patients not receiving the planned therapy in a sensitivity analysis, the results showed that the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy improved PFS compared to chemotherapy alone (HR 0.24; 95% CI 0.070 to 0.88; P = 0.03, based on one trial). For infection- related mortality (RR 6.90; 95% CI 0.36 to 132.34; P = 0.2; low- quality evidence), second cancer- related mortality (RR 2.22; 95% CI 0.7 to 7.03; P = 0.18; low- quality evidence) and cardiac disease-related mortality (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.14 to 6.90; P = 0.99; low-quality evidence), there is no evidence for a difference between the use of chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy plus radiotherapy. CRR rate was not reported. This systematic review compared the effects of chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in adults with early stage HL .For the comparison with same numbers of chemotherapy cycles in both arms, we found moderate- quality evidence that PFS is superior in patients receiving chemotherapy plus radiotherapy than in those receiving chemotherapy alone. The addition of radiotherapy to chemotherapy has probably little or no difference on OS . The sensitivity analysis without the trials with potential other high risk of bias showed that chemotherapy plus radiotherapy improves OS compared to chemotherapy alone.For the comparison with different numbers of chemotherapy cycles between the arms there are no implications for OS and PFS possible, because of the low quality of evidence of the results.

### 37. Beta-blockers in patients without heart failure after myocardial infarction.
**Authors:** Sanam Safi, Naqash J Sethi, Steven Kwasi Korang, Emil Eik Nielsen, Joshua Feinberg, Christian Gluud, Janus C Jakobsen

**Abstract:** Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 7.4 million people died from ischaemic heart disease in 2012, constituting 15% of all deaths. Beta-blockers are recommended and are often used in patients with heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. However, it is currently unclear whether beta-blockers should be used in patients without heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. Previous meta-analyses on the topic have shown conflicting results. No previous systematic review using Cochrane methods has assessed the effects of beta-blockers in patients without heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. To assess the benefits and harms of beta-blockers compared with placebo or no treatment in patients without heart failure and with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 40% in the non-acute phase after myocardial infarction. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index - Expanded, BIOSIS Citation Index, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, European Medicines Agency, Food and Drug Administration, Turning Research Into Practice, Google Scholar, and SciSearch from their inception to February 2021. We included all randomised clinical trials assessing effects of beta-blockers versus control (placebo or no treatment) in patients without heart failure after myocardial infarction, irrespective of publication type and status, date, and language. We excluded trials randomising participants with diagnosed heart failure at the time of randomisation. We followed our published protocol, with a few changes made, and methodological recommendations provided by Cochrane and Jakobsen and colleagues. Two review authors independently extracted data. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, and major cardiovascular events (composite of cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial reinfarction). Our secondary outcomes were quality of life, angina, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction during follow-up. We assessed all outcomes at maximum follow-up. We systematically assessed risks of bias using seven bias domains and we assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. We included 25 trials randomising a total of 22,423 participants (mean age 56.9 years). All trials and outcomes were at high risk of bias. In all, 24 of 25 trials included a mixed group of participants with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST myocardial infarction, and no trials provided separate results for each type of infarction. One trial included participants with only ST-elevation myocardial infarction. All trials except one included participants younger than 75 years of age. Methods used to exclude heart failure were various and were likely insufficient. A total of 21 trials used placebo, and four trials used no intervention, as the comparator. All patients received usual care; 24 of 25 trials were from the pre-reperfusion era (published from 1974 to 1999), and only one trial was from the reperfusion era (published in 2018). The certainty of evidence was moderate to low for all outcomes. Our meta-analyses show that beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention probably reduce the risks of all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 97.5% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.90; IÂ² = 15%; 22,085 participants, 21 trials; moderate-certainty evidence) and myocardial reinfarction (RR 0.76, 98% CI 0.69 to 0.88; IÂ² = 0%; 19,606 participants, 19 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). Our meta-analyses show that beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention may reduce the risks of major cardiovascular events (RR 0.72, 97.5% CI 0.69 to 0.84; 14,994 participants, 15 trials; low-certainty evidence) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.73, 98% CI 0.68 to 0.85; IÂ² = 47%; 21,763 participants, 19 trials; low-certainty evidence). Hence, evidence seems to suggest that beta-blockers versus placebo or no treatment may result in a minimum reduction of 10% in RR for risks of all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction. However, beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention may not affect the risk of angina (RR 1.04, 98% CI 0.93 to 1.13; IÂ² = 0%; 7115 participants, 5 trials; low-certainty evidence). No trials provided data on serious adverse events according to good clinical practice from the International Committee for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH-GCP), nor on quality of life. Beta-blockers probably reduce the risks of all-cause mortality and myocardial reinfarction in patients younger than 75 years of age without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. Beta-blockers may further reduce the risks of major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality compared with placebo or no intervention in patients younger than 75 years of age without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. These effects could, however, be driven by patients with unrecognised heart failure. The effects of beta-blockers on serious adverse events, angina, and quality of life are unclear due to sparse data or no data at all. All trials and outcomes were at high risk of bias, and incomplete outcome data bias alone could account for the effect seen when major cardiovascular events, angina, and myocardial infarction are assessed. The evidence in this review is of moderate to low certainty, and the true result may depart substantially from the results presented here. Future trials should particularly focus on patients 75 years of age and older, and on assessment of serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP and quality of life. Newer randomised clinical trials at low risk of bias and at low risk of random errors are needed if the benefits and harms of beta-blockers in contemporary patients without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction are to be assessed properly. Such trials ought to be designed according to the SPIRIT statement and reported according to the CONSORT statement.

**Abstract:** Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Prophylactic uterotonic drugs can prevent PPH, and are routinely recommended. There are several uterotonic drugs for preventing PPH but it is still debatable which drug is best. To identify the most effective uterotonic drug(s) to prevent PPH, and generate a ranking according to their effectiveness and side-effect profile. We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (1 June 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for unpublished trial reports (30 June 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. All randomised controlled comparisons or cluster trials of effectiveness or side-effects of uterotonic drugs for preventing PPH.Quasi-randomised trials and cross-over trials are not eligible for inclusion in this review. At least three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We estimated the relative effects and rankings for preventing PPH â‰¥ 500 mL and PPH â‰¥ 1000 mL as primary outcomes. We performed pairwise meta-analyses and network meta-analysis to determine the relative effects and rankings of all available drugs. We stratified our primary outcomes according to mode of birth, prior risk of PPH, healthcare setting, dosage, regimen and route of drug administration, to detect subgroup effects.The absolute risks in the oxytocin are based on meta-analyses of proportions from the studies included in this review and the risks in the intervention groups were based on the assumed risk in the oxytocin group and the relative effects of the interventions. This network meta-analysis included 140 randomised trials with data from 88,947 women. There are two large ongoing studies. The trials were mostly carried out in hospital settings and recruited women who were predominantly more than 37 weeks of gestation having a vaginal birth. The majority of trials were assessed to have uncertain risk of bias due to poor reporting of study design. This primarily impacted on our confidence in comparisons involving carbetocin trials more than other uterotonics.The three most effective drugs for prevention of PPH â‰¥ 500 mL were ergometrine plus oxytocin combination, carbetocin, and misoprostol plus oxytocin combination. These three options were more effective at preventing PPH â‰¥ 500 mL compared with oxytocin, the drug currently recommended by the WHO (ergometrine plus oxytocin risk ratio (RR) 0.69 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.83), moderate-quality evidence; carbetocin RR 0.72 (95% CI 0.52 to 1.00), very low-quality evidence; misoprostol plus oxytocin RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.90), moderate-quality evidence). Based on these results, about 10.5% women given oxytocin would experience a PPH of â‰¥ 500 mL compared with 7.2% given ergometrine plus oxytocin combination, 7.6% given carbetocin, and 7.7% given misoprostol plus oxytocin. Oxytocin was ranked fourth with close to 0% cumulative probability of being ranked in the top three for PPH â‰¥ 500 mL.The outcomes and rankings for the outcome of PPH â‰¥ 1000 mL were similar to those of PPH â‰¥ 500 mL. with the evidence for ergometrine plus oxytocin combination being more effective than oxytocin (RR 0.77 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.95), high-quality evidence) being more certain than that for carbetocin (RR 0.70 (95% CI 0.38 to 1.28), low-quality evidence), or misoprostol plus oxytocin combination (RR 0.90 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.14), moderate-quality evidence)There were no meaningful differences between all drugs for maternal deaths or severe morbidity as these outcomes were so rare in the included randomised trials.Two combination regimens had the poorest rankings for side-effects. Specifically, the ergometrine plus oxytocin combination had the higher risk for vomiting (RR 3.10 (95% CI 2.11 to 4.56), high-quality evidence; 1.9% versus 0.6%) and hypertension [RR 1.77 (95% CI 0.55 to 5.66), low-quality evidence; 1.2% versus 0.7%), while the misoprostol plus oxytocin combination had the higher risk for fever (RR 3.18 (95% CI 2.22 to 4.55), moderate-quality evidence; 11.4% versus 3.6%) when compared with oxytocin. Carbetocin had similar risk for side-effects compared with oxytocin although the quality evidence was very low for vomiting and for fever, and was low for hypertension. Ergometrine plus oxytocin combination, carbetocin, and misoprostol plus oxytocin combination were more effective for preventing PPH â‰¥ 500 mL than the current standard oxytocin. Ergometrine plus oxytocin combination was more effective for preventing PPH â‰¥ 1000 mL than oxytocin. Misoprostol plus oxytocin combination evidence is less consistent and may relate to different routes and doses of misoprostol used in the studies. Carbetocin had the most favourable side-effect profile amongst the top three options; however, most carbetocin trials were small and at high risk of bias.Amongst the 11 ongoing studies listed in this review there are two key studies that will inform a future update of this review. The first is a WHO-led multi-centre study comparing the effectiveness of a room temperature stable carbetocin versus oxytocin (administered intramuscularly) for preventing PPH in women having a vaginal birth. The trial includes around 30,000 women from 10 countries. The other is a UK-based trial recruiting more than 6000 women to a three-arm trial comparing carbetocin, oxytocin and ergometrine plus oxytocin combination. Both trials are expected to report in 2018.Consultation with our consumer group demonstrated the need for more research into PPH outcomes identified as priorities for women and their families, such as women's views regarding the drugs used, clinical signs of excessive blood loss, neonatal unit admissions and breastfeeding at discharge. To date, trials have rarely investigated these outcomes. Consumers also considered the side-effects of uterotonic drugs to be important but these were often not reported. A forthcoming set of core outcomes relating to PPH will identify outcomes to prioritise in trial reporting and will inform futures updates of this review. We urge all trialists to consider measuring these outcomes for each drug in all future randomised trials. Lastly, future evidence synthesis research could compare the effects of different dosages and routes of administration for the most effective drugs.

### 39. Risk perception, intended sexual behaviours and potential associated risks for sexually transmissible infections acquisition among Australian travellers: A cross-sectional study.
**Authors:** Wondimeneh Shiferaw, Deborah Mills, Kenneth Koh, Judith A Dean, Stanley Khoo, David Rutherford, Michael Tooth, Jenny Visser, Colleen Lau, Luis Furuya-Kanamori

**Abstract:** Changes in travellers' sexual behaviours, driven by opportunities during travel, contribute to the acquisition of sexually transmissible infections (STIs). However, research on travellers' risk perception, intentions regarding new sexual partners, and engagement in behaviours that may place them at potential risk of STI acquisition remains limited. This study aims to assess the risk perception and intended sexual behaviours associated with STI acquisition among Australian travellers. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from July 2023 to August 2024 among Australian residents (aged â‰¥18 years) planning to travel overseas within six months. The survey was distributed in five Travel Medicine Alliance (TMA) clinics and at the Gladstone Road Medical Centre (GRMC) clinic. Socio-demographics, travel plans, sexual intentions, STI risk perception, and patterns of intended sexual behaviours were collected. Subgroup analysis was performed on participants travelling without a partner to estimate their intention to engage in new sexual encounters. Of the 205 respondents, 172 (83.9%) attended the TMA clinics and 33 (16.1%) the GRMC clinic. The median age was 42.5 years (interquartile range 28-56 years), 51% (n = 105) were female. Nearly a quarter (22.7%, n = 29) intended to engage in sexual activity with new partners while travelling. Among these, 72.4% perceived their risk of contracting STIs as low, despite reporting intended sexual behaviours linked to STI acquisition risk such as no intention to use condoms (28.0%), intention to engage in sexual relationships with sex workers (24.1%), and plans to undergo post-travel STI testing (34.6%). Nearly half (41.4%), identified a need for better STI-related pre-travel information. A substantial proportion of surveyed travellers intended to engage in sexual activity with a new sexual partner while travelling, with many underestimating their STI risk and demonstrating intended sexual behaviours that increase their likelihood of STI acquisition. These findings underscore the need for comprehensive sexual health counselling during pre-travel consultations, with a focus on STI risk awareness, preventive strategies, and post-travel STI screening.

### 40. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for treating HIV infection in ART-eligible pregnant women.
**Authors:** Amy S Sturt, Emily Kainne Dokubo, Tin Tin Sint

**Abstract:** This systematic review focuses on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for treating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in ART-eligible pregnant women. Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the primary means by which children worldwide acquire HIV infection. MTCT occurs during three major timepoints during pregnancy and the postpartum period: in utero, intrapartum, and during breastfeeding. Strategies to reduce MTCT focus on these periods of exposure and include maternal and infant use of ART, caesarean section before onset of labour or rupture of membranes, and complete avoidance of breastfeeding. Where these combined interventions are available, the risk of MTCT is as low as 1-2%. Thus, ART used among mothers who require treatment of HIV for their own health also plays a significant role in decreasing MTCT.This review is one in a series of systematic reviews performed in preparation for the revision of the 2006 World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines regarding "Antiretroviral Drugs for Treating Pregnant Women and Preventing HIV Infection in Infants" and "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV Infections in Adults and Adolescents." The findings from these reviews were discussed with experts, key stakeholders, and country representatives at the 2009 WHO guideline review meeting. The resulting WHO 2009 "rapid advice" preliminary guidance on adult and adolescent ART now recommends lifelong treatment for all adults with HIV infection and CD4 counts <350 cells/mm(3). These recommendations also apply to pregnant women who are HIV-infected and they place a high value on early ART to benefit the mother's own health (WHO 2009). The "rapid advice" preliminary guidance also aims to minimize side effects for mothers and their infants (WHO 2009). Our objective was to assess the current literature regarding the treatment of HIV infection in pregnant women who are clinically or immunologically eligible for ART. This review includes an evaluation of the optimal time to start therapy in relation to the woman's laboratory parameters and/or gestational age. It also includes an analysis of which specific antiretroviral medications to start in women who are not yet on ART and which agents to continue in women who are already on ART. In June 2009, electronic searches were undertaken in these databases: Cochrane's "CENTRAL," EMBASE, PubMed, LILACS, and Web of Science/Web of Social Science. Hand searches were performed of the reference lists of all pertinent reviews and studies identified. Abstracts from relevant conferences were searched. Experts in the field were contacted to locate additional studies. The search strategy was iterative. We selected randomized controlled trials and observational studies that evaluated pregnant women with HIV infection who were eligible for ART according to criteria defined by the WHO guideline review committee. Studies were included in the systematic review when a comparison group was clearly defined and where the intervention comprised triple ART. For a study to be considered, each medication in the ART regimen needed to be clearly described. Two authors independently assessed the selected studies for relevance and inclusion. Relevant data was then extracted from included studies, and the risk of bias assessed. In each included study, the relative risk (RR) for the intervention versus the comparison group was calculated for each outcome, as appropriate, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To our knowledge, there are no randomized controlled trials or observational studies that address the optimal time to start antiretroviral drugs in ART-eligible pregnant women in relation to the woman's laboratory parameters and/or gestational age. The medications to continue in ART-eligible pregnant women who are already receiving ART also have not been evaluated systematically in the current literature. The long-term mortality of HIV-positive pregnant women on ART for their own health, and the long-term virologic or clinical efficacy of ART in treating them, has not been evaluated in randomized clinical trials. In this review, surrogate outcomes for long-term mortality and virologic and clinical efficacy (e.g. MTCT and infant HIV transmission or death) were evaluated to determine the efficacy of specific antiretroviral regimens to start in women who are not yet on ART.Three randomized controlled trials and six observational studies were selected. No studies addressed comparative maternal mortality, which regimens to continue in women already on ART, or the laboratory parameters and gestational age at which to start therapy. The use of zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC) and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV-r) starting at 28-36 weeks gestation in a breastfeeding population reduced infant HIV-transmission or death at 12 months compared to a short-course regimen (RR 0.64, 95% CI: 0.44-0.92) (deVincenzi, 2009). Starting AZT, 3TC, and nevirapine (NVP) at 34 weeks in a mixed-feeding population reduced infant HIV-transmission or death at 7 months compared to a short-course regimen (RR 0.39, 95% CI: 0.12-0.85) (Bae, 2008).In the Mma Bana study (a randomized controlled trial in a breastfeeding population) there was no difference in MTCT at six months between the AZT/3TC/LPV-r and AZT, 3TC, and abacavir (ABC) arms (RR 0.17, 95% CI: 0.02-1.44) (Shapiro, 2009). Both regimens also showed 92-95% efficacy in virologic suppression at delivery and during the breastfeeding period. In the Kesho Bora study there was a significant difference in MTCT at 12 months between breastfeeding women who initiated AZT/3TC/LPV-r starting between 28 and 36 weeks and those receiving a short course regimen (RR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.34-0.97) (deVincenzi, 2009). MTCT also decreased significantly when AZT/3TC/NVP was compared with a short-course regimen at seven months in a feeding intervention study (RR 0.15, 95% CI: 0.04-0.62) (Bae, 2008) and 12 months in a population where either exclusive breastfeeding or replacement feeding was encouraged (RR 0.14, CI: 0.04-0.47) (Ekouevi, 2008).In the Mma Bana study, there was increased risk of prematurity among infants born to women receiving AZT/3TC/LPV-r (RR 1.52, CI: 1.07- 2.17) compared with AZT/3TC/ABC (Shapiro, 2009). Ekouevi 2008 showed higher rates of infant low birth weight on AZT/3TC/NVP started at 24 weeks compared to a short course regimen started between 32 and 36 weeks (RR 1.81, 95% CI: 1.09- 3.0). Tonwe-Gold 2007 showed an increase in maternal severe adverse events among the women receiving AZT/3TC/NVP compared with a short-course regimen (RR 25.33, CI 1.49- 340.51). In ART-eligible pregnant women with HIV infection, ART is a safe and effective means of providing maternal virologic suppression, decreasing infant mortality, and reducing MTCT. Specifically, AZT/3TC/NVP, AZT/3TC/LPV-r, and AZT/3TC/ABC have been shown to decrease MTCT. More research is needed regarding the use of specific regimens and their maternal and infant side-effect profiles.

### 41. Intensive glucose control versus conventional glucose control for type 1 diabetes mellitus.
**Authors:** Birgit Fullerton, Klaus Jeitler, Mirjam Seitz, Karl Horvath, Andrea Berghold, Andrea Siebenhofer

**Abstract:** Clinical guidelines differ regarding their recommended blood glucose targets for patients with type 1 diabetes and recent studies on patients with type 2 diabetes suggest that aiming at very low targets can increase the risk of mortality. To assess the effects of intensive versus conventional glycaemic targets in patients with type 1 diabetes in terms of long-term complications and determine whether very low, near normoglycaemic values are of additional benefit. A systematic literature search was performed in the databases The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE. The date of the last search was December 2012 for all databases. We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that had defined different glycaemic targets in the treatment arms, studied patients with type 1 diabetes, and had a follow-up duration of at least one year. Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed studies for risk of bias, with differences resolved by consensus. Overall study quality was evaluated by the 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation' (GRADE) system. Random-effects models were used for the main analyses and the results are presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We identified 12 trials that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, including a total of 2230 patients. The patient populations varied widely across studies with one study only including children, one study only including patients after a kidney transplant, one study with newly diagnosed adult patients, and several studies where patients had retinopathy or microalbuminuria at baseline. The mean follow-up duration across studies varied between one and 6.5 years. The majority of the studies were carried out in the 1980s and all trials took place in Europe or North America. Due to the nature of the intervention, none of the studies could be carried out in a blinded fashion so that the risk of performance bias, especially for subjective outcomes such as hypoglycaemia, was present in all of the studies. Fifty per cent of the studies were judged to have a high risk of bias in at least one other category.Under intensive glucose control, the risk of developing microvascular complications was reduced compared to conventional treatment for a) retinopathy: 23/371 (6.2%) versus 92/397 (23.2%); RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.42); P < 0.00001; 768 participants; 2 trials; high quality evidence; b) nephropathy: 119/732 (16.3%) versus 211/743 (28.4%); RR 0.56 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.68); P < 0.00001; 1475 participants; 3 trials; moderate quality evidence; c) neuropathy: 29/586 (4.9%) versus 86/617 (13.9%); RR 0.35 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.53); P < 0.00001; 1203 participants; 3 trials; high quality evidence. Regarding the progression of these complications after manifestation, the effect was weaker (retinopathy) or possibly not existent (nephropathy: RR 0.79 (95% CI 0.37 to 1.70); P = 0.55; 179 participants with microalbuminuria; 3 trials; very low quality evidence); no adequate data were available regarding the progression of neuropathy. For retinopathy, intensive glucose control reduced the risk of progression in studies with a follow-up duration of at least two years (85/366 (23.2%) versus 154/398 (38.7%); RR 0.61 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.76); P < 0.0001; 764 participants; 2 trials; moderate quality evidence), while we found evidence for an initial worsening of retinopathy after only one year of intensive glucose control (17/49 (34.7%) versus 7/47 (14.9%); RR 2.32 (95% CI 1.16 to 4.63); P = 0.02; 96 participants; 2 trials; low quality evidence).Major macrovascular outcomes (stroke and myocardial infarction) occurred very rarely, and no firm evidence could be established regarding these outcome measures (low quality evidence).We found that intensive glucose control increased the risk for severe hypoglycaemia, however the results were heterogeneous and only the 'Diabetes Complications Clinical Trial' (DCCT) showed a clear increase in severe hypoglycaemic episodes under intensive treatment. A subgroup analysis according to the baseline haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of participants in the trials (low quality evidence) suggests that the risk of hypoglycaemia is possibly only increased for patients who started with relatively low HbA1c values (< 9.0%). Several of the included studies also showed a greater weight gain under intensive glucose control, and the risk of ketoacidosis was only increased in studies using insulin pumps in the intensive treatment group (very low quality evidence).Overall, all-cause mortality was very low in all studies (moderate quality evidence) except in one study investigating renal allograft as treatment for end-stage diabetic nephropathy. Health-related quality of life was only reported in the DCCT trial, showing no statistically significant differences between the intervention and comparator groups (moderate quality evidence). In addition, only the DCCT published data on costs, indicating that intensive glucose therapy control was highly cost-effective considering the reduction of potential diabetes complications (moderate quality evidence). Tight blood sugar control reduces the risk of developing microvascular diabetes complications. The evidence of benefit is mainly from studies in younger patients at early stages of the disease. Benefits need to be weighed against risks including severe hypoglycaemia, and patient training is an important aspect in practice. The effects of tight blood sugar control seem to become weaker once complications have been manifested. However, further research is needed on this issue. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence from RCTs on the effects of tight blood sugar control in older patient populations or patients with macrovascular disease. There is no firm evidence for specific blood glucose targets and treatment goals need to be individualised taking into account age, disease progression, macrovascular risk, as well as the patient's lifestyle and disease management capabilities.

### 42. Post-transplant survival with pre-transplant durable continuous-flow mechanical circulatory support in a Swiss cohort of heart transplant recipients.
**Authors:** Roger Hullin, Tamila Abdurashidova, Barbara Pitta-Gros, Sara Schukraft, Valentina Rancati, Henri Lu, Anouck Zurbuchen, Carlo Marcucci, Zied Ltaief, Karl Lefol, Christoph Huber, Manuel Pascual, Piergiorgio Tozzi, Philippe Meyer, Matthias Kirsch

**Abstract:** Worldwide, almost half of all heart transplantation candidates arrive today at their transplant operation with durable continuous-flow mechanical circulatory support (CF-MCS). This evolution is due to a progressive increase of waiting list time and hence an increased risk of haemodynamic worsening. Longer duration of CF-MCS is associated with a higher risk of device-related complications with potential adverse impact on post-transplant outcome as suggested by recent results from the United Network of Organ Sharing of the United States. A 2-centre Swiss heart transplantation programme conducted a retrospective observational study of consecutive patients of theirs who underwent a transplant in the period 2008-2020. The primary aim was to determine whether post-transplant all-cause mortality is different between heart transplant recipients without or with pre-transplant CF-MCS. The secondary outcome was the acute cellular rejection score within the first year post-transplant. The study participants had a median age of 54 years; 38/158 (24%) were females. 53/158 study participants (34%) had pre-transplant CF-MCS with a median treatment duration of 280 days. In heart transplant recipients with pre-transplant CF-MCS, the prevalence of ischaemic cardiomyopathy was higher (51 vs 32%; p = 0.013), the left ventricular ejection fraction was lower (20 vs 25; p = 0.047) and pulmonary vascular resistance was higher (2.3 vs 2.1 Wood Units; p = 0.047). Over the study period, the proportion of heart transplant recipients with pre-transplant CF-MCS and the duration of pre-transplant CF-MCS treatment increased (2008-2014 vs 2015-2020: 22% vs 45%, p = 0.009; increase of treatment days per year: 34.4 Â± 11.2 days, p = 0.003; respectively). The primary and secondary outcomes were not different between heart transplant recipients with pre-transplant CF-MCS or direct heart transplantation (log-rank p = 0.515; 0.16 vs 0.14, respectively; p = 0.81). This data indicates that the strategy of pre-transplant CF-MCS with subsequent orthotopic heart transplantation provides post-transplant outcomes not different to direct heart transplantation despite the fact that the duration of pre-transplant assist device treatment has progressively increased.

### 43. Exercise interventions and patient beliefs for people with hip, knee or hip and knee osteoarthritis: a mixed methods review.
**Authors:** Michael Hurley, Kelly Dickson, Rachel Hallett, Robert Grant, Hanan Hauari, Nicola Walsh, Claire Stansfield, Sandy Oliver

**Abstract:** Chronic peripheral joint pain due to osteoarthritis (OA) is extremely prevalent and a major cause of physical dysfunction and psychosocial distress. Exercise is recommended to reduce joint pain and improve physical function, but the effect of exercise on psychosocial function (health beliefs, depression, anxiety and quality of life) in this population is unknown. To improve our understanding of the complex inter-relationship between pain, psychosocial effects, physical function and exercise. Review authors searched 23 clinical, public health, psychology and social care databases and 25 other relevant resources including trials registers up to March 2016. We checked reference lists of included studies for relevant studies. We contacted key experts about unpublished studies. To be included in the quantitative synthesis, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of land- or water-based exercise programmes compared with a control group consisting of no treatment or non-exercise intervention (such as medication, patient education) that measured either pain or function and at least one psychosocial outcome (self-efficacy, depression, anxiety, quality of life). Participants had to be aged 45 years or older, with a clinical diagnosis of OA (as defined by the study) or self-reported chronic hip or knee (or both) pain (defined as more than six months' duration).To be included in the qualitative synthesis, studies had to have reported people's opinions and experiences of exercise-based programmes (e.g. their views, understanding, experiences and beliefs about the utility of exercise in the management of chronic pain/OA). We used standard methodology recommended by Cochrane for the quantitative analysis. For the qualitative analysis, we extracted verbatim quotes from study participants and synthesised studies of patients' views using framework synthesis. We then conducted an integrative review, synthesising the quantitative and qualitative data together. Twenty-one trials (2372 participants) met the inclusion criteria for quantitative synthesis. There were large variations in the exercise programme's content, mode of delivery, frequency and duration, participant's symptoms, duration of symptoms, outcomes measured, methodological quality and reporting. Comparator groups were varied and included normal care; education; and attention controls such as home visits, sham gel and wait list controls. Risk of bias was high in one and unclear risk in five studies regarding the randomisation process, high for 11 studies regarding allocation concealment, high for all 21 studies regarding blinding, and high for three studies and unclear for five studies regarding attrition. Studies did not provide information on adverse effects.There was moderate quality evidence that exercise reduced pain by an absolute percent reduction of 6% (95% confidence interval (CI) -9% to -4%, (9 studies, 1058 participants), equivalent to reducing (improving) pain by 1.25 points from 6.5 to 5.3 on a 0 to 20 scale and moderate quality evidence that exercise improved physical function by an absolute percent of 5.6% (95% CI -7.6% to 2.0%; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.27, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.17, equivalent to reducing (improving) WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) function on a 0 to 100 scale from 49.9 to 44.3) (13 studies, 1599 participants)). Self-efficacy was increased by an absolute percent of 1.66% (95% CI 1.08% to 2.20%), although evidence was low quality (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.58, equivalent to improving the ExBeliefs score on a 17 to 85 scale from 64.3 to 65.4), with small benefits for depression from moderate quality evidence indicating an absolute percent reduction of 2.4% (95% CI -0.47% to 0.5%) (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.02, equivalent to improving depression measured using HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) on a 0 to 21 scale from 3.5 to 3.0) but no clinically or statistically significant effect on anxiety (SMD -0.11, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.05, 2% absolute improvement, 95% CI -5% to 1% equivalent to improving HADS anxiety on a 0 to 21 scale from 5.8 to 5.4; moderate quality evidence). Five studies measured the effect of exercise on health-related quality of life using the 36-item Short Form (SF-36) with statistically significant benefits for social function, increasing it by an absolute percent of 7.9% (95% CI 4.1% to 11.6%), equivalent to increasing SF-36 social function on a 0 to 100 scale from 73.6 to 81.5, although the evidence was low quality. Evidence was downgraded due to heterogeneity of measures, limitations with blinding and lack of detail regarding interventions. For 20/21 studies, there was a high risk of bias with blinding as participants self-reported and were not blinded to their participation in an exercise intervention.Twelve studies (with 6 to 29 participants) met inclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis. Their methodological rigour and quality was generally good. From the patients' perspectives, ways to improve the delivery of exercise interventions included: provide better information and advice about the safety and value of exercise; provide exercise tailored to individual's preferences, abilities and needs; challenge inappropriate health beliefs and provide better support.An integrative review, which compared the findings from quantitative trials with low risk of bias and the implications derived from the high-quality studies in the qualitative synthesis, confirmed the importance of these implications. Chronic hip and knee pain affects all domains of people's lives. People's beliefs about chronic pain shape their attitudes and behaviours about how to manage their pain. People are confused about the cause of their pain, and bewildered by its variability and randomness. Without adequate information and advice from healthcare professionals, people do not know what they should and should not do, and, as a consequence, avoid activity for fear of causing harm. Participation in exercise programmes may slightly improve physical function, depression and pain. It may slightly improve self-efficacy and social function, although there is probably little or no difference in anxiety. Providing reassurance and clear advice about the value of exercise in controlling symptoms, and opportunities to participate in exercise programmes that people regard as enjoyable and relevant, may encourage greater exercise participation, which brings a range of health benefits to a large population of people.

### 44. Tirzepatide and health-related quality of life in adults with obesity or overweight: Results from the SURMOUNT-3 phase 3 randomized trial.
**Authors:** Theresa Hunter Gibble, Dachuang Cao, Tammy Forrester, Julia Fraseur Brumm, Ariana M Chao

**Abstract:** Tirzepatide reduced weight significantly more than placebo in adults with obesity/overweight who had already achieved â‰¥5% weight reduction with a 12-week intensive lifestyle intervention (randomized population) in SURMOUNT-3, a phase 3, 72-week, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. This analysis evaluated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with tirzepatide versus placebo treatment in the SURMOUNT-3 randomized population and selected subgroups. The randomized population received placebo (Nâ€‰=â€‰292) or tirzepatide maximum tolerated dose (Nâ€‰=â€‰287) for 72â€‰weeks. HRQoL was assessed from randomization to week 72 using the Short Form-36 Version 2 Health Survey acute form, Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite Clinical Trials Version, 5-level EQ-5D version Health State Index, EQ visual analogue scale and the Patient Global Impression of Status (PGIS) for Physical Activity. In tirzepatide recipients, changes in HRQoL scores from randomization to week 72 were descriptively summarized by achievement of weight reduction thresholds, and for those with versus without physical function limitations at randomization (identified with PGIS for Physical Activity). Tirzepatide was associated with significantly larger improvements than placebo in most HRQoL measures from randomization to 72â€‰weeks. Improvements in tirzepatide recipients were generally numerically larger in those who met greater weight reduction thresholds. HRQoL score changes showed greater improvements for adults with versus without physical function limitations for all measures. Tirzepatide improved HRQoL in adults with obesity/overweight and was generally associated with larger improvements in adults meeting greater weight reduction thresholds and in adults with versus without reported physical function limitations at randomization. What is the context and purpose of this research study? In a clinical trial called SURMOUNT-3, tirzepatide was significantly better than placebo for reducing weight in adults with obesity/overweight who had already lost â‰¥5% weight following a 12-week intensive lifestyle programme. This analysis looked at the effects of tirzepatide compared with placebo for 72â€‰weeks on quality of life (QoL) in SURMOUNT-3. In addition, among tirzepatide recipients, the relationship between meeting different weight reduction thresholds and changes in QoL was described as was the association of tirzepatide with QoL in study participants who had physical limitations at randomization. What was done? Eligible adults with obesity/overweight were enrolled in a 12-week intensive lifestyle programme. Those who lost â‰¥5% of initial weight at the end of the 12â€‰weeks were invited to continue participating in the study and were randomly assigned to receive injections of either their maximum tolerated dose of tirzepatide (10 or 15â€‰mg) or placebo for 72â€‰weeks via single-dose pens. QoL was measured using a number of well-established surveys that assessed general health, the impact of weight on QoL and the impact of health on the level of physical ability in day-to-day life. These surveys were completed by the study participants when they were first assigned treatment with tirzepatide or placebo (randomization) and again after 72â€‰weeks of treatment. The difference in scores from randomization to week 72 was then calculated to determine whether or not the QoL of participants had improved with treatment. In addition, in participants who took tirzepatide, changes in QoL scores from randomization to week 72 were summarized by weight reduction thresholds (â‰¥5%, â‰¥10%, â‰¥15%, â‰¥20%, â‰¥25%), and for those with versus without physical limitations at randomization. What were the main results? Adults with obesity/overweight who had already lost â‰¥5% weight with a 12-week intensive lifestyle programme who then took tirzepatide for 72â€‰weeks not only had significantly more weight loss compared with those taking placebo, but they also had significantly improved QoL. These improvements in QoL were generally larger with greater weight loss and in adults who reported physical limitations at randomization compared to those who reported no such limitations. The improvements in QoL were observed in physical function as well as in general mental health and weight-related psychological and social functions. What is the originality and relevance of this study? Findings of this study show that in addition to reducing weight in people who have already lost â‰¥5% weight after lifestyle interventions, tirzepatide improved QoL. This is important because other studies have shown that people with obesity have reduced QoL. Tirzepatide was generally associated with improved QoL the most in adults who had greater weight loss and in adults who reported physical limitations at randomization.

### 45. Glucose-lowering agents for treating pre-existing and new-onset diabetes in kidney transplant recipients.
**Authors:** Clement Lo, Min Jun, Sunil V Badve, Helen Pilmore, Sarah L White, Carmel Hawley, Alan Cass, Vlado Perkovic, Sophia Zoungas

**Abstract:** Kidney transplantation is the preferred form of kidney replacement therapy for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and is often complicated by worsening or new-onset diabetes. Management of hyperglycaemia is important to reduce post-transplant and diabetes-related complications. The safety and efficacy of glucose-lowering agents after kidney transplantation is largely unknown. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions for lowering glucose levels in patients who have undergone kidney transplantation and have diabetes. We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 15 April 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE; handsearching conference proceedings; and searching the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and cross-over studies examining head-to-head comparisons of active regimens of glucose-lowering therapy or active regimen compared with placebo/standard care in patients who have received a kidney transplant and have diabetes were eligible for inclusion. Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and quality and performed data extraction. Continuous outcomes were expressed as post-treatment mean differences (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD). Adverse events were expressed as post-treatment absolute risk differences (RD). Dichotomous clinical outcomes were presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We included seven studies that involved a total of 399 kidney transplant recipients. All included studies had observed heterogeneity in the patient population, interventions and measured outcomes or missing data (which was unavailable despite correspondence with authors). Many studies had incompletely reported methodology preventing meta-analysis and leading to low confidence in treatment estimates.Three studies with 241 kidney transplant recipients examined the use of more intensive compared to less intensive insulin therapy in kidney transplant recipients with pre-existing type 1 or 2 diabetes. Evidence for the effects of more intensive compared to less intensive insulin therapy on transplant graft survival, HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, all cause mortality and adverse effects including hypoglycaemia was of very low quality. More intensive versus less intensive insulin therapy resulted in no difference in transplant or graft survival over three to five years in one study while another study showed that more intensive versus less intensive insulin therapy resulted in more rejection events over the three year follow-up (11 events in total; 9 in the more intensive group, P = 0.01). One study showed that more intensive insulin therapy resulted in a lower mean HbA1c (10 Â± 0.8% versus 13 Â± 0.9%) and lower fasting blood glucose (7.22 Â± 0.5 mmol/L versus 13.44 Â± 1.22 mmol/L) at 13 months compared with standard insulin therapy. Another study showed no difference between more intensive compared to less intensive insulin therapy on all-cause mortality over a five year follow-up period. All studies showed either an increased frequency of hypoglycaemia or severe hypoglycaemia episodes.Three studies with a total of 115 transplant recipients examined the use of DPP4 inhibitors for new-onset diabetes after transplantation. Evidence for the treatment effect of DPP4 inhibitors on transplant or graft survival, HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels, all cause mortality, and adverse events including hypoglycaemia was of low quality. One study comparing vildagliptin to placebo and another comparing sitagliptin to placebo showed no difference in transplant or graft survival over two to four months of follow-up. One study comparing vildagliptin to placebo showed no significant change in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline (1.9 Â± 10.3 mL/min/1.73 m Evidence concerning the efficacy and safety of glucose-lowering agents for treating pre-existing and new-onset diabetes in kidney transplant recipients is limited. Existing studies examine more intensive versus less intensive insulin therapy, and the use of DPP4 inhibitors and pioglitazone. The safety and efficacy of more intensive compared to less intensive insulin therapy is very uncertain and the safety and efficacy of DPP4 inhibitors and pioglitazone is uncertain, due to data being limited and of poor quality. Additional RCTs are required to clarify the safety and efficacy of current glucose-lowering agents for kidney transplant recipients with diabetes.

### 46. Are Current Survival Prediction Tools Useful When Treating Subsequent Skeletal-related Events From Bone Metastases?
**Authors:** Yu-Ting Pan, Yen-Po Lin, Hung-Kuan Yen, Hung-Ho Yen, Chi-Ching Huang, Hsiang-Chieh Hsieh, Stein Janssen, Ming-Hsiao Hu, Wei-Hsin Lin, Olivier Q Groot

**Abstract:** Bone metastasis in advanced cancer is challenging because of pain, functional issues, and reduced life expectancy. Treatment planning is complex, with consideration of factors such as location, symptoms, and prognosis. Prognostic models help guide treatment choices, with Skeletal Oncology Research Group machine-learning algorithms (SORG-MLAs) showing promise in predicting survival for initial spinal metastases and extremity metastases treated with surgery or radiotherapy. Improved therapies extend patient lifespans, increasing the risk of subsequent skeletal-related events (SREs). Patients experiencing subsequent SREs often suffer from disease progression, indicating a deteriorating condition. For these patients, a thorough evaluation, including accurate survival prediction, is essential to determine the most appropriate treatment and avoid aggressive surgical treatment for patients with a poor survival likelihood. Patients experiencing subsequent SREs often suffer from disease progression, indicating a deteriorating condition. However, some variables in the SORG prediction model, such as tumor histology, visceral metastasis, and previous systemic therapies, might remain consistent between initial and subsequent SREs. Given the prognostic difference between patients with and without a subsequent SRE, the efficacy of established prognostic models-originally designed for individuals with an initial SRE-in addressing a subsequent SRE remains uncertain. Therefore, it is crucial to verify the model's utility for subsequent SREs. We aimed to evaluate the reliability of the SORG-MLAs for survival prediction in patients undergoing surgery or radiotherapy for a subsequent SRE for whom both the initial and subsequent SREs occurred in the spine or extremities. We retrospectively included 738 patients who were 20 years or older who received surgery or radiotherapy for initial and subsequent SREs at a tertiary referral center and local hospital in Taiwan between 2010 and 2019. We excluded 74 patients whose initial SRE was in the spine and in whom the subsequent SRE occurred in the extremities and 37 patients whose initial SRE was in the extremities and the subsequent SRE was in the spine. The rationale was that different SORG-MLAs were exclusively designed for patients who had an initial spine metastasis and those who had an initial extremity metastasis, irrespective of whether they experienced metastatic events in other areas (for example, a patient experiencing an extremity SRE before his or her spinal SRE would also be regarded as a candidate for an initial spinal SRE). Because these patients were already validated in previous studies, we excluded them in case we overestimated our result. Five patients with malignant primary bone tumors and 38 patients in whom the metastasis's origin could not be identified were excluded, leaving 584 patients for analysis. The 584 included patients were categorized into two subgroups based on the location of initial and subsequent SREs: the spine group (68% [399]) and extremity group (32% [185]). No patients were lost to follow-up. Patient data at the time they presented with a subsequent SRE were collected, and survival predictions at this timepoint were calculated using the SORG-MLAs. Multiple imputation with the Missforest technique was conducted five times to impute the missing proportions of each predictor. The effectiveness of SORG-MLAs was gauged through several statistical measures, including discrimination (measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]), calibration, overall performance (Brier score), and decision curve analysis. Discrimination refers to the model's ability to differentiate between those with the event and those without the event. An AUC ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, with 0.5 indicating the worst discrimination and 1.0 indicating perfect discrimination. An AUC of 0.7 is considered clinically acceptable discrimination. Calibration is the comparison between the frequency of observed events and the predicted probabilities. In an ideal calibration, the observed and predicted survival rates should be congruent. The logarithm of observed-to-expected survival ratio [log(O:E)] offers insight into the model's overall calibration by considering the total number of observed (O) and expected (E) events. The Brier score measures the mean squared difference between the predicted probability of possible outcomes for each individual and the observed outcomes, ranging from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating perfect overall performance and 1 indicating the worst performance. Moreover, the prevalence of the outcome should be considered, so a null-model Brier score was also calculated by assigning a probability equal to the prevalence of the outcome (in this case, the actual survival rate) to each patient. The benefit of the prediction model is determined by comparing its Brier score with that of the null model. If a prediction model's Brier score is lower than the null model's Brier score, the prediction model is deemed as having good performance. A decision curve analysis was performed for models to evaluate the "net benefit," which weighs the true positive rate over the false positive rate against the "threshold probabilities," the ratio of risk over benefit after an intervention was derived based on a comprehensive clinical evaluation and a well-discussed shared-decision process. A good predictive model should yield a higher net benefit than default strategies (treating all patients and treating no patients) across a range of threshold probabilities. For the spine group, the algorithms displayed acceptable AUC results (median AUCs of 0.69 to 0.72) for 42-day, 90-day, and 1-year survival predictions after treatment for a subsequent SRE. In contrast, the extremity group showed median AUCs ranging from 0.65 to 0.73 for the corresponding survival periods. All Brier scores were lower than those of their null model, indicating the SORG-MLAs' good overall performances for both cohorts. The SORG-MLAs yielded a net benefit for both cohorts; however, they overestimated 1-year survival probabilities in patients with a subsequent SRE in the spine, with a median log(O:E) of -0.60 (95% confidence interval -0.77 to -0.42). The SORG-MLAs maintain satisfactory discriminatory capacity and offer considerable net benefits through decision curve analysis, indicating their continued viability as prediction tools in this clinical context. However, the algorithms overestimate 1-year survival rates for patients with a subsequent SRE of the spine, warranting consideration of specific patient groups. Clinicians and surgeons should exercise caution when using the SORG-MLAs for survival prediction in these patients and remain aware of potential mispredictions when tailoring treatment plans, with a preference for less invasive treatments. Ultimately, this study emphasizes the importance of enhancing prognostic algorithms and developing innovative tools for patients with subsequent SREs as the life expectancy in patients with bone metastases continues to improve and healthcare providers will encounter these patients more often in daily practice. Level III, prognostic study.

### 47. Bone marrow versus peripheral blood allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for haematological malignancies in adults.
**Authors:** Udo Holtick, Melanie Albrecht, Jens M Chemnitz, Sebastian Theurich, Nicole Skoetz, Christof Scheid, Michael von Bergwelt-Baildon

**Abstract:** Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an established treatment option for many malignant and non-malignant disorders. In the past two decades, peripheral blood stem cells replaced bone marrow as stem cell source due to faster engraftment and practicability. Previous meta-analyses analysed patients treated from 1990 to 2002 and demonstrated no impact of the stem cell source on overall survival, but a greater risk for graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in peripheral blood transplants. As transplant indications and conditioning regimens continue to change, whether the choice of the stem cell source has an impact on transplant outcomes remains to be determined. To assess the effect of bone marrow versus peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in adult patients with haematological malignancies with regard to overall survival, incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality, disease-free survival, transplant-related mortality, incidence of GvHD and time to engraftment. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (from 1948 to February 2014), trial registries and conference proceedings. The search was conducted in October 2011 and was last updated in February 2014. We did not apply any language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing bone marrow and peripheral blood allogeneic stem cell transplantation in adults with haematological malignancies. Two review authors screened abstracts and extracted and analysed data independently. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We included nine RCTs that met the pre-defined selection criteria, involving a total of 1521 participants. Quality of data reporting was heterogeneous among the studies. Overall, the risk of bias in the included studies was low.For the primary outcome overall survival, our analysis demonstrated comparable results between bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) (six studies, 1330 participants; hazard ratio (HR) 1.07; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.25; P value = 0.43; high-quality evidence).Disease-free survival (six studies, 1225 participants; HR 1.04; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.21; P value = 0.6; moderate-quality of evidence) and non-relapse or transplant-related mortality (three studies, 758 participants; HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.28; P = 0.91; high-quality evidence) were also comparable between transplantation arms.In the related-donor setting, data from two of eight studies with 211 participants (21%) indicated a higher relapse incidence in participants transplanted with bone marrow stem cells rather than peripheral blood stem cells (HR 2.73; 95% CI 1.47 to 5.08; P value = 0.001). There was no clear evidence of a difference in relapse incidence between transplantation groups in unrelated donors (HR 1.07; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.47; P value = 0.66). The difference between the donor-related and -unrelated subgroups (P-value = 0.008) was considered to be statistically significant.BMT was associated with lower rates of overall and extensive chronic GvHD than PBSCT (overall chronic GvHD: four studies, 1121 participants; HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.85; P value = 0.0001, extensive chronic GvHD: four studies, 765 participants; HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.9; P value = 0.006; moderate-quality evidence for both outcomes). The incidence of acute GvHD grades II to IV was not lower (six studies, 1330 participants; HR 1.03; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.21; P value = 0.67; moderate-quality evidence), but there was a trend for a lower incidence of grades III and IV acute GvHD with BMT than with PBSCT (three studies, 925 participants; HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.02; P value = 0.07; moderate-quality evidence).Times to neutrophil and platelet engraftment were longer with BMT than with PBSCT (neutrophil: five studies, 662 participants; HR 1.96; 95% CI 1.64 to 2.35; P value < 0.00001; platelet: four studies, 333 participants; HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.69 to 2.78; P value < 0.00001). This systematic review Â found high-quality evidence that overall survival following allo-HSCT using the current clinical standard stem cell source - peripheral blood stem cells - was similar to that following allo-HSCT using bone marrow stem cells in adults with haematological malignancies. We found moderate-quality evidence that PBSCT was associated with faster engraftment of neutrophils and platelets, but a higher risk of GvHD (in terms of more overall and extensive chronic GvHD). There was an imprecise effect on relapse andÂ on severe (grades III to IV) acute GvHD. Quality of life, which is severely affected by GvHD, was not evaluated.Against the background of transplantation practices that have clearly changed over the past 10 to 15 years, our aim was to provide current data on the best stem cell source for allo-HSCT, by including the results of recently conducted trials. Our review includes participants recruited up to 2009, a proportion of whom were older, had received reduced-intensity conditioning regimens or had been transplanted with stem cells from unrelated donors. However, only one, large, study included relatively recently treated participants. Nevertheless, our findings are comparable to those of previous meta-analyses suggesting that our results hold true for today's practice.

### 48. Knowledge, attitudes, practices and vaccine acceptance towards seasonal influenza vaccination among international travelers: a cross-sectional survey in Thailand.
**Authors:** Pathomthep Leowattana, Viravarn Luvira, Noppadon Tangpukdee, Panita Looareesuwan, Tanaya Siripoon, Thundon Ngamprasertchai, Suparat Phuanukoonnon, Pornthep Chanthavanich

**Abstract:** Influenza is a common but preventable disease. International travelers encounter significant risks in contracting influenza. The cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted on international travelers while visiting the Thai Travel Clinic at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Bangkok, Thailand. From May to November 2024, 250 Thai and 229 non-Thai international travelers were enrolled. Most participants reported sufficient knowledge about influenza, with 86.4Â % achieving a score of â‰¥60Â % while expressing mild concern of infection [mean perceived risk score of 3.1Â Â±Â 2.4 (range from 0 to 10)]. When regarding preventive measures, 72.2Â % reported regular hand hygiene, while only 19.4Â % regularly wore masks in public. Influenza vaccine acceptance was 38.2Â %. The most influential reason for vaccination was healthcare personnel's advice. In the multivariable analysis, the independent factors which affected vaccine acceptance were travelers' nationality, age, purpose of travel, destination country, and perceived risk score. International travelers had sufficient influenza knowledge but low awareness relating to influenza prevention methods and influenza vaccinations. Low vaccine acceptance rates were observed among international travelers. Travel consultations should focus on influenza awareness while traveling and associated preventative measures.
